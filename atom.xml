        <content type="html"><![CDATA[Part 1 - An architectural introduction    Welcome to a new series exploring a retail architecture blueprint. It's focusing on presenting access to ways of mapping successful implementations for specific use cases.        It's an interesting challenge creating architectural content based on common customer adoption patterns. That's very different from most of the traditional marketing activities usually associated with generating content for the sole purpose of positioning products for solutions. When you're basing the content on actual execution in solution delivery, you're cutting out the chuff.   What's that mean?  It means that it's going to provide you with a way to implement a solution using open source technologies by focusing on the integrations, structures and interactions that actually have been proven to work. What's not included are any vendor promises that you'll find in normal marketing content. Those promised that when it gets down to implementation crunch time, might not fully deliver on their promises.  Enter the term Architectural Blueprint.   Let's look at these blueprints, how their created and what value they provide for your solution designs.     THE PROCESS  The first step is to decide the use case to start with, which in my case had to be linked to a higher level theme that becomes the leading focus. This higher level theme is not quite boiling the ocean, but it's so broad that it's going to require some division in to smaller parts.  In this case we've aligned with the higher level theme being 'Retail' use cases, a vertical focus. This breaks down into the following use cases and in no particular order:  *   *   *   *   *   * Real-time stock control  * Retail data framework  The case we're tackling here is focused on Store Health and Safety. This use case we've defined as the following:    Managing effective in-store compliance, health & safety, and employee checks and procedures.   The approach taken is to research our existing customers that have implemented solutions in this space, collect their public facing content, research the internal implementation documentation collections from their successful engagements, and where necessary reach out to the field resources involved.    To get an idea of what these blueprints look like, we refer you to the series previously discussed here:   *   *   *   *   Now on to the task at hand.     WHAT'S NEXT  The resulting content for this project targets the following three items.   * A slide deck of the architectural blueprint for use telling the portfolio    solution story.  * Generic architectural diagrams providing the general details for the    portfolio solution.  * A write-up of the portfolio solution in a series that can be used for a    customer solution brief.  An overview of this series on store health and safety portfolio architecture blueprint:   1.   2. Common architectural elements  3. Example health and safety architecture  Catch up on any past articles you missed by following any published links above.  Next in this series, taking a look at the generic common architectural elements for the store health and safety architecture.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[  This year the event is a bit different as we bridge the gap from pandemic reality to hopefully a form of normalcy.     As the to us, this "...event is expanding to become an all-new, flexible conference series, consisting of a 2‑part immersive virtual experience as well as a global tour of small-scale, in-person* events. This series will create collective opportunities to share experiences, innovations, and insights."  Part one is from April 27-28, where you can start your Red Hat Summit journey by joining us for this no-cost event, where you can get the latest news, ask the experts your technology questions, hear from customers around the globe, and learn how open source is innovating the future of the enterprise. There will be keynotes, spotlights, live demos, and access to Red Hatters from around the globe.  Part two is from June 15-16, and you can build on what you learned at April’s event with insights from breakout sessions and technical content geared toward the tracks and topics most relevant to your career. You can also interact live with Red Hat professionals at this no-cost event. More depth at this event with the breakout sessions, ask the experts sessions, and a virtual expo hall.  Finally, you noticed the star marking the part three event above? That's because this part of the event we hope allows us to meet in-person, but the ongoing situation means Red Hat will "...continue to monitor the ongoing global health crisis and make adjustments to the Red Hat Summit agenda to help ensure the health, safety, and well-being of everyone within the open source community."  If all goes well, then you can cap your Red Hat Summit experience somewhere from Oct - Nov "...by exploring hands-on activities at in-person events that will be held in several cities. The networking opportunities can help you find the inspiration to discover who you want to be and the tools to do what you want to do." There will be hands-on labs, 1-1 meetings, and training courses available during this final event series.     This year I'm involved with some friends and colleagues in a few Ask The Experts sessions where you get a live session on a topic with several experts available to ask anything you like about the topic.  I'm going to be involved in the following two sessions.        ''If the rate of change on the outside is faster than the rate of change on the inside, the end is near.'' - Jack Welch. The way applications are built, integrated, run, and monitored has changed dramatically over the years. They change because businesses and organizations need to adapt to change and to growing customer requirements more quickly and frequently than ever before. Red Hat's vision of an open hybrid cloud environment embraces an architecture that includes agile integration, DevOps, CI/CD pipelines, microservices, containers, and event-driven architectures—all to help you meet the requirements of change at speed. In this session, experts who have seen, studied, and developed architectural blueprints from successful customer open hybrid cloud solutions will share their insights and discoveries with you. It's a unique chance to engage, ask questions, or just listen as we share some of the best insights into architecting your successful future in an open hybrid cloud environment.   Date: Wed, 28 April 2021 Time: 09:00 - 09:30 CET Speakers: Benjamin Farr, Senior Solution Architect, Manfred Bortenschlager, Business Development Manager, Ronald Meuwsen, Go-to-Market Manager, and Eric Schabell, Portfolio Architect Director        The world is constantly challenging our abilities to adapt, overcome, and transform as businesses strive to meet their customers needs and expectations. What does digital transformation mean for you, and where are you in the journey to become a fully digital partner to your customers? In this session, speakers from across the Red Hat leadership spectrum who are having these exact conversations with our customers around the world, will answer your burning questions from your own digital journey. From cloud-native strategies to the organizational shifts that are part of a digital transformation journey, take this unique opportunity to engage, ask questions, or just listen as we share insights from successful customer journeys and help you shape your own digital transformation in these challenging times.   Date: Wed, 28 April 2021  Time: 09:30 - 10:00 CET Speakers: Brendan McErlain, Vice President, Portfolio Product Marketing, Andreas Spanner, Chief Architect, and Eric Schabell, Portfolio Architect Director   Make sure you as it's free and full of great open source technologies, customer cases, labs, and more. I hope to see you there and if not, then feel free to drop in at a later date as they will be linking recordings of these sessions back into for your viewing pleasure. ]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[WildFly 23.0.1.Final is now available .  It’s been about a month since the WildFly 23 release, so we’ve done a bug fix update, WildFly 23.0.1.   WILDFLY PREVIEW AND JAKARTA EE 9.0  The big news in this release is the fact that the of the server passes the TCKs for the Jakarta EE 9.0 and the . We’ve sent a to Eclipse. We’d previously been able to for WildFly Preview 23.0.0.  I’m very excited about this achievement and am so proud of the great WildFly contributors who made it happen, particularly Scott Marlow, Richard Opalka, Jean-Francois Denise, Geoffrey DeSmet, Emmanuel Hugonnet, Farah Juma, Jason Lee, Jim Ma, Matej Novotny, Flavia Rainone and Parul Sharma.  As is described in the , WildFly Preview is a tech preview variant of the server meant to allow our community to get an early look at new things we’re looking to eventually bring into the standard WildFly variant. Currently, the main (but not only) difference from standard WildFly is support of Jakarta EE 9 instead of EE 8.  WildFly Preview is not a compatible Jakarta EE 8 or MicroProfile Platform 4.0 implementation, although we do expect most apps using the EE 8 and MP 4 APIs to run well on it.  WildFly Preview is available on the , next to the standard WildFly download links for the same version. Look for the 'WildFly Preview EE 9 Distribution' links.   RELEASE NOTES  The full list of issues resolved in WildFly 23.0.1 is available . Issues resolved in the WildFly Core update included with WildFly 23.0.1 are available .  Enjoy!]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[Part 3 - Example headless architectures   In our  from this series shared a look at the logical common architectural elements found in a headless e-commerce solution for retail stores.    The process was laid out how we've approached the use case and how portfolio solutions are the base for researching a generic architectural blueprint. It continued by laying out the process of how we've approached the use case by researching successful customer portfolio solutions as the basis for a generic architectural blueprint.   Having completed our discussions on the logical view of the blueprint, it's now time to look at a specific example.  This article walks you through an example headless e-commerce platform scenario showing how expanding the previously discussed elements provides a blueprint for your own headless e-commerce scenarios.     BLUEPRINTS REVIEW  As mentioned before, the architectural details covered here are base on real solutions using open source technologies. The example scenario presented here is a generic common blueprint that was uncovered researching those solutions. It's our intent to provide a blueprint that provides guidance and not deep technical details.  This section covers the visual representations as presented, but it's expected that they'll be evolving based on future research. There are many ways to represent each element in this architectural blueprint, but we've chosen a format that we hope makes it easy to absorb. Feel free to post comments at the bottom of this post, or  with your feedback.   Now let's take a look at the details in this blueprint and outline the solution for two approaches to delivering a cloud-native approach.        HEADLESS WITH LOCAL CONTAINER ARCHITECTURE  The first of the two architecture examples focuses on two tasks within this architecture. First, the cloud-native approach to delivery using local container tooling and second, on the elements delivered to provide for a loosely coupled headless e-commerce platform experience.   A close examination shows that we have a Developer collection of elements, one for the Dev infrastructure, and a final one on the right for the Test infrastructure hosted by a container platform. The rest of this section outlines each element shown and describes how a developer using local container tooling delivers from their development environment, through a development infrastructure on to the test infrastructure. The reader is left to work out the cycles needed to get from test to production.   Starting with the developers collection of tools, we find everything needed for them to design, develop, and preview testing of their applications. There are runtimes, maven repository, source code management system most often git-based, and of course the container tooling. Note that there are several ways to trigger the push of new code to the dev infrastructure, using git hooks, maven plugins, or file uploads from the container tooling.    That previously mentioned push of the finished code kicks off a build in the dev CI/CD element to generate an image that's added to the image repository. From this image an instance is spun up in the dev infrastructure for testing and should it pass it's then tagged as tested and copied by the registry management element to the next infrastructure level.   Incoming images for the test infrastructure are copied into the image registry for deployment into the test container platform. In this level we see some of the key elements in our headless e-commerce solution. In the lighter box we see frontend microservices, messaging, and integration data microservices. These are providing services to frontend applications, message transformation and delivery, and communications with data sources.    After that there are a few customer focused elements; customer brand adapter microservices, customer composite microservices, customer core microservices, and customer anti-corruption microservices. Each of these collections of services help support applications as they interact with customers in the e-commerce experience.    Finally, there are the integration microservices that ensure communication with other parts of the organisations backend systems and, in the example included here, with the testing interface. A tester is shown using api management to authorise and authenticate access to a web application that provides a test experience with the headless e-commerce deployment found on the test infrastructure.   Next up, a look at the architectural solution with development teams using remote container tooling.        HEADLESS WITH REMOTE CONTAINER ARCHITECTURE  This second architecture example is presenting the cloud-native approach to delivery using remote container tooling, followed by the elements providing a loosely coupled headless e-commerce platform experience.   First off let's define this remote container tooling and what it means. The difference when using remote container tooling is fully integrating with a container platform from the developer through to production. Local container tooling requires an integration point where you copy the tested application image using special tools from the developer infrastructure image registry to the container platform image registry.    Now that we're clear on the subject at hand, let's start once again on the right of the above architecture and explore what developers are using to design, develop, and preview testing of their applications. There are runtimes, maven repository, source code management system most often git-based, and of course the container tooling. This container tooling is specifically focused on a container platform and is using the OpenShift client tooling so that developers are working directly with a development cluster just like every level of the infrastructure through to production. This is shown in the above image as the developer infrastructure consists of a container platform and a container platform CI/CD. The developer still has options on how to trigger the push of new code to the dev infrastructure, using git hooks, maven plugins, or oc client tooling.    As a side note, it's also an option to place the above shown development infrastructure directly on the local machine of the developer. For examples of how this works, please explore the and some of the demo projects found on .   When the developer pushes their code it's shown here heading to the container platform CI/CD where a source to image S2I workflow build process triggers. The CI/CD platform manages this build and if successful creates a development tagged image that's put into the container platform image registry. The development image is automatically deployed into the dev container platform and the developer can continue testing and development until it's ready for promotion to the next environment. Note developer access is shown here using API management as that's the same headless e-commerce application setup to be found in production.   When all development testing has finished the CI/CD platform element tags the resulting image as testImage and it's pushed into the test container platform's image registry. This automatically deploys the headless e-commerce images to the test infrastructure and testing can proceed on the application and services as before.   Again, we see some of the key elements of our headless e-commerce solution. In the lighter box we see frontend microservices, messaging, and integration data microservices. These are providing services to frontend applications, message transformation and delivery, and communications with data sources.    After that there are a few customer focused elements; customer brand adapter microservices, customer composite microservices, customer core microservices, and customer anti-corruption microservices. Each of these collections of services help support applications as they interact with customers in the e-commerce experience.    Finally, there are the integration microservices that ensure communication with other parts of the organisations backend systems and, in the example included here, with the testing interface. A tester is shown using api management to authorise and authenticate access to a web application that provides a test experience with the headless e-commerce deployment found on the test infrastructure.    Further deployment through to an acceptance and production infrastructure is similar to the process shown and described here above. For simplicity and to provide an overview of the solution we've chosen to model development to testing only.     WHAT'S NEXT  This was just a short overview of the common generic elements that make up our architecture blueprint for the headless e-commerce use case.    An overview of this series on the headless e-commerce portfolio architecture blueprint can be found here:   1.   2.   3.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[Part 2 - Common architectural elements   In our  from this series we introduced a use case around headless e-commerce for retail stores.    The process was laid out how we've approached the use case and how portfolio solutions are the base for researching a generic architectural blueprint.    The only thing left to cover was the order in which you'll be led through the blueprint details.  This article starts the real journey at the very top, with a generic architecture from which we'll discuss the common architectural elements one by one.   This will start our journey into the logical elements that make up the headless e-commerce architecture blueprint.     BLUEPRINTS REVIEW  As mentioned before, the architectural details covered here are base on real solutions using open source technologies. The example scenario presented here is a generic common blueprint that was uncovered researching those solutions. It's our intent to provide a blueprint that provides guidance and not deep technical details.  This section covers the visual representations as presented, but it's expected that they'll be evolving based on future research. There are many ways to represent each element in this architectural blueprint, but we've chosen a format that we hope makes it easy to absorb. Feel free to post comments at the bottom of this post, or  with your feedback.   Now let's take a look at the details in this blueprint and outline the solution.     FROM SPECIFIC TO GENERIC  Before diving in to the common elements, it might be nice to understand that this is not a catch all for every possible supply chain integration solution. It's a collection of identified elements that we've uncovered in multiple customer implementations. These elements presented here are then the generic common architectural elements that we've identified and collected in to the generic architectural blueprint.    It's our intent to provide a blueprint for guidance and not deep technical details. You're smart enough to figure out wiring integration points in your own architectures. You're capable of slotting in the technologies and components you've committed to in the past where applicable.  It's our job here to describe the architectural blueprint generic components and outline a few specific cases with visual diagrams so that you're able to make the right decisions from the start of your own projects.    Another challenge has been how to visually represent the architectural blueprint. There are many ways to represent each element, but we've chosen some icons, text and colours that we hope are going to make it all easy to absorb.    Now let's take a quick tour of the generic architecture and outline the common elements uncovered in my research.     DEVELOPER  As you notice from the beginning, this logical diagram starts with a focus on cloud native development and the developer. For those that have looked at already, you'll notice the developer is central to delivering the components used in a headless e-commerce solution.   For this blueprint the researched customers provided, as you could image, a diverse set of developer elements to choose from. We've chosen to group some and selected the elements shown in the image.   The developer IDE is pretty universal, the tooling that the developer is coding in. Some form of source code management repository is used, but all research pointed to a Git-based repository. The remaining elements encompass as selection of the enterprise frameworks encountered, but are not by any means definitive. We captured integration based on Camel and Fuse, and often some collection of Java runtimes.   While not illustrated as a distinct component, some form of dependency management was employed. In all researched cases it was an Apache Maven repository, but we've chosen to leave them out of this logical overview for the reasons of simplicity.      CONTAINER PLATFORM CI / CD   A container platform hosting the continuous integration (CI) and continuous development (CD) tooling is the main element in this group. The CI/CD platform can be any number of available tools, but as a concrete example, many implementations are using Jenkins tooling.   Here you again see the SCM repertory as an element just like you saw in the previous developer section. This represents the connection between developer and collecting project artefacts for use in the container CI/CD platform for testing, tagging, and rolling out to various infrastructure environments in a retail organisation.      PRESENTATION TIER   This tier is used to collect the elements used for front end presentation for the headless e-commerce suite. This can be any number of applications used by customers to interact with the e-commerce platform, but also third parties allowed to interact with the platform.     All of these applications can be found in the generic element web applications, with a secondary element called frontend microservices that represent integration points for applications into the headless e-commerce platform.      CONTAINER PLATFORM   The bulk of the headless e-commerce platform can be found here in the container platform where a collection of services and communication tools are provided independent elements of deployment that support a cohesive whole.   A core element of any integration platform is to provide some form of messaging to ensure that both communication and transformation of that communication is possible across the headless e-commerce platform.    Both integration microservices and integration data microservices are elements that consistently provide access to backend organisational systems, data sources, and other aspects of the retail organisation such as real-time stock control solutions or the retail data framework. In other articles, we'll cover these two architecture blueprints and you can search for them on this site for more details.    To support customer interaction throughout the headless e-commerce platform there are collections of microservices, each focusing on one aspect of the customer interaction.  These are very generic descriptions as each retail organisation can determine what they consider core services.   The first group is referred to as customer brand adapter microservices that ensure specific focus on creating a brand connection with the customer on your platform.    Another set of services are called the customer composite microservices that focus on coarser grained interactions with customers on their shopping journey in your online store. The basic set of services are called the customer core microservices and provide the basic interactions with customers for all parts of the e-commerce platform.    A final element is a collection of customer anti-corruption microservices that is a grouping related to the processes around payments for customers that might need access to processes around anti-money laundering or other fraud related detection mechanisms. There are often legal aspects to your specific country that effects what you need to comply with regarding corruption detection, so that's left to the reader to pursue with their retail organisations legal department.     INFRASTRUCTURE SERVICES  These elements in the common architecture were pretty consistent across all of the Headless eCommerce solutions examined. These tended to be core elements setup in the retail organisations central location with the ability to control communication and overall integration for the complete architecture.   A centralised integration element here is outside of the container platform integration elements discussed in the previous section and has a focus on more legacy integration aspects of an existing retail organisation.    The API management element here is for access to the headless e-commerce platform both by customers and also for third party connectivity to anything that your organisation might want to expose for use.     It goes without saying (almost), that a single-sign-on (SSO) server is essential for tying in the organisational tooling for authorisation and authentication to make use of components in the architecture.     STORAGE SERVICES    The storage services uncovered in this solution space was a fairly narrow with traditional relational database management system storage element and the open source Ceph storage solution.  There was not a lot of need for diversity in these services as the solution is squarely focused on the development and delivery pipeline for the e-commerce elements.     WHAT'S NEXT  This was just a short overview of the common generic elements that make up our architecture blueprint for the headless e-commerce imaging use case.    An overview of this series on the headless e-commerce portfolio architecture blueprint can be found here:   1.   2.   3. Example headless architectures  Catch up on any articles you missed by following one of the links above.  Next in this series, taking a look at an example headless architecture to provide you with a map for your own e-commerce solution.

        <updated>2021-04-08T05:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[In the last months, the Design Tools Team released many cool new features on and . This post will do a quick overview of those. I hope you enjoy it!   DASHBUILDER PROGRAMMATIC LAYOUT API  Until the launch of this new API, the only way to create dashboards on Dashbuilder was via drag and drop on Layout Editor. Now, users can create their Dashboards, pages, components, and data sets directly on Java.  Here is an example of the usage of such API:  import org.dashbuilder.dataset.* import org.dashbuilder.displayer.DisplayerSettings; import org.dashbuilder.dsl.factory.component.ComponentFactory; import org.dashbuilder.dsl.factory.dashboard.DashboardFactory; import org.dashbuilder.dsl.model.* import org.dashbuilder.dsl.serialization.* import static java.util.Arrays.asList; import static org.dashbuilder.dataset.DataSetFactory.newDataSetBuilder; import static org.dashbuilder.displayer.DisplayerSettingsFactory.newBarChartSettings; import static org.dashbuilder.dsl.factory.navigation.NavigationFactory.*; import static org.dashbuilder.dsl.factory.page.PageFactory.*; public class SimpleDashboard { public static void main(String[] args) { DataSet dataSet = newDataSetBuilder().column("Country", ColumnType.LABEL) .column("Population", ColumnType.NUMBER) .row("Brazil", "211") .row("United States", "328") .row("Cuba", "11") .row("India", "1366") .row("China", "1398") .buildDataSet(); DisplayerSettings populationBar = newBarChartSettings().subType_Column() .width(800) .height(600) .dataset(dataSet) .column("Country") .column("Population") .buildSettings(); Page page = page("Countries Population", row("<h3> Countries Population </h3>"), row(ComponentFactory.displayer(populationBar))); Navigation navigation = navigation(group("Countries Information", item(page))); Dashboard populationDashboard = DashboardFactory.dashboard(asList(page), navigation); DashboardExporter.get().export(populationDashboard, "/path/to/export.zip", ExportType.ZIP); } }  hosted with ❤ by   It will generate the following dashboard:  We also introduced a “dev mode” to Dashbuilder Runtime, which automatically updates the Dashbuilder Runtime while developing and exporting the ZIP. Soon, we will publish a blog post with more details about this new feature, but meanwhile, a sneak peek of authoring workflow using it:   DMN EDITOR – ENHANCED CODE-COMPLETION FOR LITERAL FEEL EXPRESSIONS  Context-aware code completion is one of the most important features an IDE can provide to speed up coding, reduce typos and avoid other common mistakes. On Kogito Tooling 0.9.0 release, we introduced enhanced code-completion for Literal FEEL expressions.  Check out this video:    See this full for details.   BPMN EDITOR – READ-ONLY MODE  Since October, we also ship our editors as a standalone npm package. One of my favorite features of the standalone is the read-only mode because it is really useful for diagram visualization. Now, this mode is also supported on BPMN. The read-only mode is also used for the visualization of diagrams on our Chrome Extension.   WORK ITEM DEFINITION SUPPORT IMPROVEMENTS  To evolve our Work Item Definition support on Kogito Tooling BPMN editor, we included on 0.9.0 a lot of improvements in this area, primarily related to a better parsing mechanism and also better compatibility with Business Central. Now, we also search for wids and icons the ‘global’ directory used on BC.   DASHBUILDER PROMETHEUS DATA SET PROVIDER  Dashbuilder can read data from multiple types of data set sources, including CSV, SQL, ElasticSearch, and Kie Server. Since Business central 7.50.0 Final, we introduced a new type of provider for data sets: Prometheus.  Prometheus is the standard for collecting metrics. It has connectors to very well-known systems, such as Kafka and metrics can be easily consumed from third-party systems. Furthermore, Kie Server by default also exports ! See a sample Dashboard based on Prometheus data:  For a full description of this new feature, take a look at this .   DASHBUILDER KAFKA DATA SET PROVIDER  We also recently introduced Dashbuilder support for Kafka data sets. Kafka is the standard event streaming platform for cloud applications and RHPAM/Kogito systems expose metrics using Kafka, so this is the reason why we added Kafka support on Dashbuilder as a data set provider.  Soon we will publish a blog post with more details about this new feature.   DASHBUILDER TIME SERIES DISPLAYER  This new component represents time-series metrics to smoothly support the new Prometheus data-set provider.  Now, you can provide a custom dataset or Prometheus metrics and create visualizations of your time series data on a line or area chart using Dashbuilder. See this for more details.   GWT 2.9 AND JDK11 UPGRADE  After a collective effort involving many people from a lot of different teams, we also did two major upgrades on our codebase, supporting JDK11 compilation and GWT 2.9 on Business Central. This is a huge effort in a sizable codebase, so congrats to everyone involved!   OTHER IMPORTANT ISSUES AND IMPROVEMENTS:  BPMN:   * Move the structure option to the top of the Data Type drop-down  * – [BPMN] Open subprocesses in a new editor on BC only  * Stunner – Text area for scripts is cropped/shifted  * Stunner – Not all illegal characters are removed from Data Object name  * : Erase of WID ‘nodes’ types  DMN:   * Move the structure option to the top of the Data Type drop-down  * Allow sorting in guided decision table when clicking the column name  SCESIM   * Test Scenario does not support nested Enum type attributes  * Scenario Simulation type error popup when constraint applied to DMN data type  * Display actual test results instead of a generic message  * SceSim runner does not display reason for failure   THANK YOU TO EVERYONE INVOLVED!  I would like to thank everyone involved with this release, from the excellent KIE Tooling Engineers to the lifesavers QEs and the UX people that help us look awesome!

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[The JBPM KIE server has a rich set of REST APIs that allows control over business processes and other business assets. Interaction with business processes is straightforward and easily accessible. Usually these APIs are used by the Business Central component and custom applications. In this post I want to give a simple example of how to interact with business processes, deployed in a KIE server, using Apache Camel. Utilizing business processes in a camel route, as you will see, is pretty easy!  There is an available component in Camel called simply the component. Both consumers and producers are supported. The consumer side has already been covered by Maciej in this excellent . My example will focus on the producer side.   WHAT INTERACTIONS ARE AVAILABLE?  The JBPM component uses exchange headers to hold the operations/commands used to interact with the KIE server. The query parameters in the URL holds the security and deployment information. The following is an example of an JBPM URL.  jbpm:http://localhost:8080/kie-server/services/rest/server?userName=myuser&password=mypass&deploymentId=mydeployment  That URL above will interact with the KIE server running on localhost port 8080, the container deployed as mydeployment, and using the user myuser and password mypass. Of course all these values can be parameterized.  The following table shows some of the interactions available as of version Apache Camel 3.8. The header key for the operation header is JBPMConstants.OPERATION. All supported header keys are listed in the JBPMConstants class.  OperationSupport HeadersDescriptionstartProcessPROCESS_ID PARAMETERSStart a process in the deployed container (in URL) and the process definition ID and any parameters.signalEventPROCESS_INSTANCE_ID EVENT_TYPE EVENTSignal a process instance with the signal (EVENT_TYPE) and payload (EVENT). If process instance ID is missing then the signal scope will be defaultgetProcessInstancePROCESS_INSTANCE_IDRetrieve the process instance using the ID. The resulting exchange body will be populated by a org.kie.server.api.model.instance.ProcessInstance object.completeWorkItemPROCESS_INSTANCE_ID WORK_ITEM_ID PARAMETERSComplete the work item using the parameters.  You can find the complete list in the org.apache.camel.component.jbpm.JBPMProducer.Operation enum.   SIMPLE EXAMPLE  In this example we’ll be using the following versions:   *   *   Install and start the JBPM KIE server.  > docker pull jboss/jbpm-server-full > docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 8001:8001 -d --name jbpm-server-full jboss/jbpm-server-full:latest  Log into Business Central () using wbadmin/wbadmin as the credentials. In the default MySpace, create a project call test-camel and a business process in it call test-camel-process. Add a process variable call data of type String. Add a script task to print out data. Save and deploy the project.  To quickly stand up a Camel environment, we’ll be using Spring Boot. The following command will help you create the spring boot project:  mvn archetype:generate \   -DarchetypeGroupId=org.apache.camel.archetypes \   -DarchetypeArtifactId=camel-archetype-spring-boot \   -DarchetypeVersion=3.8.0  In the resulting project, add the following dependency into the pom.xml file.      <dependency>       <groupId>org.apache.camel.springboot</groupId>       <artifactId>camel-jbpm-starter</artifactId>     </dependency>  Add the following to the application.properties file.  server.port = 8280 jbpm.server.url = http://localhost:8080/kie-server/services/rest/server jbpm.server.user = wbadmin jbpm.server.pass = wbadmin jbpm.deployment.id = test-camel_1.0.0-SNAPSHOT jbpm.process.id = test-camel.test-camel-process jbpm.process.data = data  Modify the MySpringBootRouter.java file to add some routes. The following code snippet will start a process.       @Override     public void configure() {         from("timer:startprocess?delay=1000&period=5000")                       .to("direct:startprocess");          from("direct:startprocess")             .setHeader(JBPMConstants.OPERATION, constant("CamelJBPMOperationstartProcess"))             .setHeader(JBPMConstants.PROCESS_ID, simple("{{jbpm.process.id}}"))             .process((Exchange exchange) -> {                     String dataName = exchange.getContext().resolvePropertyPlaceholders("{{jbpm.process.data}}");                     Map<String, Object> params = new HashMap<>();                     params.put(dataName, "hello world");                     exchange.getIn().setHeader(JBPMConstants.PARAMETERS, params);             })             .to("jbpm:{{jbpm.server.url}}?userName={{jbpm.server.user}}&password={{jbpm.server.pass}}&deploymentId={{jbpm.deployment.id}}");     }   The above example will send "hello world" as the data to start the process in the KIE server. By default without specifying JBPMConstants.OPERATION, the operation will be to start the process. The reason the operation is set to CamelJBPMOperationstartProcess is the operation is an aggregation of the value of JBPMConstants.OPERATION and the enum value defined in org.apache.camel.component.jbpm.JBPMProducer.Operation. Unfortunately we cannot use the operation enum directly because it’s not exposed publicly.  The post appeared first on .]]></content>

        <id>/blog/2021/04/07/infinispan-12-1-0-final</id>
        <link href="/blog/2021/04/07/infinispan-12-1-0-final"/>
        <updated>2021-04-07T12:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[Dear Infinispan community,  As a belated surprise in your chocolate egg this year is a brand new final release. Infinispan 12.1 includes a bunch of new features and fixes.   OUT-OF-THE-BOX AUTHORIZATION IN THE SERVER  The biggest change is the fact that the server now enables authorization right from the start, including a set of predefined roles. By default this only affects management ops and it can be easily disabled.  Head over to for details on this feature and how to tune it to your own needs.   CONFIGURATION  Infinispan can now load configuration as YAML, as well as XML and JSON.   SOFT-INDEX FILE STORE  The Soft-Index File Store (or SIFS for short) is one of our file-based stores, and it has received a number of improvements such as segmentation, non-blocking and requiring no additional threads. Additionally, if you are lucky enough to have some persistent memory hardware, this file-store can support it via the very awesome . We hope to make this our default file-store in the future (replacing the Single File Store).   SERVER PROTOCOL MANAGEMENT  You can now enable/disable protocol endpoints at runtime or use for fine-grained access control.   CONSOLE  The console is now fully aware of the server authorization roles (if enabled) and many fixes are included.   CLI  The CLI is now available as for Linux and MacOS.   CROSS SITE REPLICATION  You can now enable automatic Cross Site for asynchronous backup strategy.   SPRING  Our Spring Cache and Spring Session integration now allows user keys and values to be stored in format. However, full integration with the Infinispan Spring Boot Starter is landing in the next minor release. Stay tuned!   MARSHALLING/PROTOBUF  The latest ProtoStream release 4.4.0.Beta3 includes support for marshalling arrays and collections, built-in support for several community requested types (UUID, BigDEcimal,… ), a new method in ProtobufUtil for computing message size (without actually encoding the message) and a lot of bug fixes. This release also provides it’s own protobuf encoder and removes the dependency on protobuf-java artifact which was previously used for encoding the stream (without being exposed by the API).   IMAGES  We now provide an image containing a natively compiled version of the Infinispan CLI at quay.io/infinispan/cli   OPERATOR  In addition to numerous fixes, the operator has added many new features. Most notably:   * Grafana Dashboard   * Batch CR   * Custom library support   * Custom labels on Resources created by Operator   * Disable Authentication Option   * Decouple user and operator endpoint authentication   DOCUMENTATION  We’ve made a lot of updates to our documentation this release, with lots more task-oriented content for new features and capabilities. Server credential stores, refactored authorization (RBAC) configuration, Operator Batch CR, Backup and Restore CRs, custom code deployments, automatic cross-site state transfer, querying values, configuring Protobuf annotations for marshalling… Hopefully you’ll find all the answers you need for using Infinispan 12.1.  One of the big highlights for docs in this release are the new tabbed configuration snippets we’re going to start adding. Right now you can find an example of tabbed configuration in the REST API docs here:  We’ve also done a lot of housekeeping in this release to make sure configuration examples are up to date and valid. In the next release you can expect to see more improvements there as well as a new title to improve our documentation around encoding and how Infinispan uses Protobuf.  As always, thanks for reading and get in touch if you have comments, feedback, or suggestions on our documentation.   RELEASE NOTES AND UPGRADING  You can look at the detailed to see what has changed since CR1. If you are upgrading from a previous version of Infinispan, please checkout our .   WHAT’S NEXT ?  Our next release, 13.0, should happen during the summer, and will hopefully introduce a new API which will make using Infinispan much easier, as well as a number of other improvements across the board. As usual, look out for blog postings about upcoming highlights. If you’d like to contribute, just get in touch.]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[Part 1 - An architectural introduction  We're kicking off another series sharing a new architecture blueprint. It's focusing on presenting access to ways of mapping successful implementations for specific use cases.      It's an interesting challenge creating architectural content based on common customer adoption patterns. That's very different from most of the traditional marketing activities usually associated with generating content for the sole purpose of positioning products for solutions. When you're basing the content on actual execution in solution delivery, you're cutting out the chuff.   What's that mean?  It means that it's going to provide you with a way to implement a solution using open source technologies by focusing on the integrations, structures and interactions that actually have been proven to work. What's not included are any vendor promises that you'll find in normal marketing content. Those promised that when it gets down to implementation crunch time, might not fully deliver on their promises.  Enter the term Architectural Blueprint.   Let's look at these blueprints, how their created and what value they provide for your solution designs.     THE PROCESS  The first step is to decide the use case to start with, which in my case had to be linked to a higher level theme that becomes the leading focus. This higher level theme is not quite boiling the ocean, but it's so broad that it's going to require some division in to smaller parts.  In this case we've aligned with the higher level theme being 'Retail' use cases, a vertical focus. This breaks down into the following use cases and in no particular order:  *   *   *   *   * Store health and safety  * Real-time stock control  * Retail data framework  The case I'm tackling here is focused on Headless eCommerce. This use case we've defined as the following:    Deploying a container based eCommerce website while moving away from tightly coupled existing eCommerce platform.   The approach taken is to research our existing customers that have implemented solutions in this space, collect their public facing content, research the internal implementation documentation collections from their successful engagements, and where necessary reach out to the field resources involved.     To get an idea of what these blueprints look like, we refer you to the series previously discussed here:   *   *   *   *   Now on to the task at hand.      WHAT'S NEXT  The resulting content for this project targets the following three items.   * A slide deck of the architectural blueprint for use telling the portfolio    solution story.  * Generic architectural diagrams providing the general details for the    portfolio solution.  * A write-up of the portfolio solution in a series that can be used for a    customer solution brief.  An overview of this series on headless e-commerce portfolio architecture blueprint:   1.   2. Common architectural elements  3. Example headless architectures  Catch up on any past articles you missed by following any published links above.  Next in this series, taking a look at the generic common architectural elements for a headless e-commerce architecture.   (Article co-authored by , Chief Architect Retail, Red Hat) ]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[ABOUT  With the VSCode Kogito Bundle extension, you can author processes, rules, or test scenarios directly in VSCode without the need to run the whole Business Central.  If you would like to know how to create, build and deploy the projects in VSCode, or you would like to integrate the Business Central and VSCode Kogito projects, you are in the right place.  Important note: Although the integration described in this post works for most use cases, it is not supported by Red Hat products.   PREPARE THE ENVIRONMENT  The first thing you will need to do is to prepare the environment. It is recommended to use the latest versions when using any of the following software/tools unless specified otherwise.  Versions used in this post:   * OpenJDK: 1.8+ (e.g. 1.8.0_282 or 11.0.10)  * Maven: 3.6.3  * Git: 2.30.2  * VSCode: 1.46.0+ (e.g. 1.54.3)  * Kogito Bundle extension: 0.8.6  * Business Central: 7.51.0.Final  * KIE server: 7.51.0.Final   TOOLS  GIT  To migrate projects between Business Central and VSCode, you need to have installed on your local machine.  MAVEN  To generate projects in VSCode and build them, ensure you have installed .  Note, you might need to install first if it’s not already pre-installed in your OS. See the system for Maven for more information.   VSCODE AND KOGITO  Install and open on your machine. You can find installation instructions here: .  KOGITO BUNDLE EXTENSION  You can install the bundle via UI:  Open Extensions in VSCode, find Kogito Bundle, and click install.  Alternatively, you can use VSCode Quick Open:   1. Launch VSCode Quick Open (by pressing “Ctrl + P“)  2. Paste the following command: ext install     kie-group.vscode-extension-kogito-bundle  3. Finally, press enter.   BUSINESS CENTRAL AND KIE SERVER  There are more possibilities for how to prepare the environment to run Business Central and KIE server. You can find information about installation in guide or .  You can download an already prepared and configured Business Central with KIE server here: or here: to speed up the setting process.   Once the file is downloaded, unzip it to your working directory (for example, to ~/jbpm-kogito-home/).  To run Business Central, open terminal and execute the following commands:  # Change directory to business Central’s bin: cd ${BUSINESS_CENTRAL_HOME}/bin # on Linux cd ~/jbpm-kogito-home/jbpm-server-7.51.0.Final-dist/bin # on Windows cd C:\home\admin\jbpm-kogito-home\jbpm-server-7.51.0.Final-dist\bin # Run standalone script. # on Linux ./standalone.sh # on Windows standalone.bat  hosted with ❤ by   Wait until deployment is finished. You should see something like this in the terminal:  INFO org.kie.workbench.common.screens.datasource.management.backend.DataSourceManagementBootstrap Initialize deployments task finished successfully.  Login to Business Central:   1. Open the web browser and enter the address:  2. Login with username: wbadmin password: wbadmin   MIGRATE PROJECTS FROM BUSINESS CENTRAL TO VSCODE  If you have properly configured the environment, we can proceed with importing projects from Business Central to VSCode. Note, this workflow should work for the most of the use cases, but if you experience any issues, please report it here: .  Create or open any project in Business Central:   * Navigate to Menu -> Projects  * You can create a new project by clicking the Add Project button or you can    open any Sample project by clicking on Try Samples, select project(s) and    click Ok.  Once you have a Business Central project, there are two options how to migrate it to VSCode. The first and preferred one is to clone the repository using git. The second option is to download it using GUI.   CLONE THE PROJECT USING GIT  To clone the repository, open Business Central, navigate to Project’s Settings, locate URL property, choose either ssh or http from the drop-down menu and copy the link. Alternatively you can use the local git repository that you can find in the “.niogit” folder of your Business Central, but this is not recommended.  Open the terminal in VSCode by clicking on Terminal -> New Terminal or use “Ctrl + Shift + `” shortcut and execute these commands:  # cd $WORKING_DIRECTORY cd ~/jbpm-kogito-home/ # mkdir $PROJECTS mkdir projects # cd $WORKING_DIRECTORY/$PROJECTS cd ~/jbpm-kogito-home/projects ################################################### # To clone repository, execute one of the following ################################################### # git clone http://localhost:8080/business-central/git/$SPACE_NAME/$PROJECT_NAME git clone http://localhost:8080/business-central/git/MySpace/Mortgage_Process # use wbadmin:wbadmin credentials when asked to authenticate # git clone ssh://localhost:8001/$SPACE_NAME/$PROJECT_NAME git clone ssh://localhost:8001/MySpace/Mortgage_Process # git clone ${BUSINESS_CENTRAL_HOME}/bin/.niogit/$SPACE_NAME/$PROJECT_NAME.git git clone ~/jbpm-kogito-home/jbpm-server-7.51.0.Final-dist/bin/.niogit/MySpace/Mortgage_Process.git  hosted with ❤ by    DOWNLOAD THE PROJECT USING GUI  To download the project using GUI in Business Central, follow the instructions below:   1. Open any asset in the project in Business Central  2. Open Project Explorer  3. Click on the Cogwheel icon  4. Click on Download Project       5. Unzip the project.  Note, there is no Git repository cloned if you downloaded the project using Business Central GUI. If you would like to push/pull changes between Business Central and VSCode, you need to set up a remote repository first by executing the following commands:  # cd $WORKING_DIRECTORY/$PROJECTS/$PROJECT_NAME cd ~/jbpm-kogito-home/projects/Mortgage_Process git init ######################################################## # To add remote repository, execute one of the following ######################################################## # git remote add origin http://localhost:8080/business-central/git/$SPACE_NAME/$PROJECT_NAME git remote add origin http://localhost:8080/business-central/git/MySpace/Mortgage_Process # git remote add origin ssh://localhost:8001/$SPACE_NAME/$PROJECT_NAME git remote add origin ssh://localhost:8001/MySpace/Mortgage_Process # git remote add origin ${BUSINESS_CENTRAL_HOME}/bin/.niogit/$SPACE_NAME/$PROJECT_NAME.git git remote add origin ~/jbpm-kogito-home/jbpm-server-7.51.0.Final-dist/bin/.niogit/MySpace/Mortgage_Process.git ######################################################## git add . git pull origin master  hosted with ❤ by    OPEN THE PROJECT  Now open the cloned/downloaded project in VSCode. There are two options.  The first option is to use the VSCode terminal.  Execute the following commands, hover over the project’s path (the return value of pwd command), and press “Ctrl + Click“. The project will open in a new window.  # cd $WORKING_DIRECTORY/$PROJECTS/$PROJECT_NAME cd ~/jbpm-kogito-home/projects/Mortgage_Process pwd  hosted with ❤ by   The second option is to use VSCode GUI.  Click File -> Open folder or use “Ctrl + O” shortcut, locate the root folder of the project, and then click OK.  Tip: If you don’t want to close the current project, you can open a new window using the shortcut “Ctrl + Shift + N” before opening the project.   CREATE A PROJECT IN VSCODE  You can also create your own projects from scratch directly in VSCode, instead of transferring them from Business Central.  You can do that by generating a kjar project skeleton with a Maven archetype command.  If you want to create more projects, use properties with specific GAV when generating projects. If you want to create a Case project, specify it by using caseProject property when generating projects.  Open terminal in VSCode by clicking on Terminal -> New Terminal or use “Ctrl + Shift + `” shortcut and execute the following commands:  # Navigate to your projects working directory # cd $WORKING_DIRECTORY/$PROJECTS/ cd ~/jbpm-kogito-home/projects ############################## # Execute one of the following ############################## # Create a project using maven archetype mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeGroupId=org.kie -DarchetypeArtifactId=kie-kjar-archetype -DarchetypeVersion=7.51.0.Final # Create a project using maven archetype with specific GAV # If you want create more projects, you can also specify GAV of your project by adding these properties to the command: -DgroupId=<my.groupid> -DartifactId=<my-artifactId> mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeGroupId=org.kie -DarchetypeArtifactId=kie-kjar-archetype -DarchetypeVersion=7.51.0.Final -DgroupId=org.kie.businessapp -DartifactId=businessapp-two # Create a Case project using maven archetype # If you want to create a skeleton for Case project, add -DcaseProject=true property to the command mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeGroupId=org.kie -DarchetypeArtifactId=kie-kjar-archetype -DarchetypeVersion=7.51.0.Final -DcaseProject=true  hosted with ❤ by   During the project generation, it will ask you to confirm the configuration. Press y to confirm it and then Enter.  If you are experiencing issues with generating the artifact, ensure you have configured the maven repositories properly. Note, the command might not work properly in PowerShell when trying to execute it on Windows. Use Cmd prompt instead.   CREATE ASSETS IN VSCODE  If you have successfully created the project skeleton, it is time to create all assets and necessary files for your project.   KOGITO EDITORS  There are currently three different editors provided by Kogito VSCode extension: BPMN, DMN and Test Scenario.  BPMN EDITOR  Files with bpmn extension $BPMN_FILE_NAME.bpmn are handled by the BPMN, respectively Business Process editor. You can design processes with this modeler.  DMN EDITOR  Files with dmn extension $DMN_FILE_NAME.dmn are handled by the DMN editor. You can design decisions with this modeler.  SCESIM EDITOR  Files with scesim extension $SCESIM_FILE_NAME.scesim are handled by the Test Scenario editor. You can design test scenarios for testing your DMN assets with this modeler.  Note, the pop-up dialog will ask you to select the DMN asset when creating Test Scenario. Therefore make sure you create it in advance.  CREATE ASSETS  If you create/open any of the listed assets above, an editor will open.  To use VSCode GUI, follow the instructions below:   1. Open the project (click on Explorer in upper left corner)  2. Create the missing folders by right click on the location -> New folder.     * src/main/resources/$PACKAGE (e.g. src/main/resources/org/kie/businessapp)       Use this location for BPMN and DMN assets.     * src/test/resources/$PACKAGE (e.g. src/test/resources/org/kie/businessapp)       Use this location for SCESIM assets.  3. Select the location, click on New File, and input file name with the desired     extension (e.g. process.bpmn, dmn.dmn or test-scenario.scesim).  The other option is to use a terminal. Execute following commands:  ############################ # Create BPMN and DMN assets ############################ # cd $WORKING_DIRECTORY/$PROJECTS/$PROJECT_NAME/src/main/resources/ cd ~/jbpm-kogito-home/projects/mybusinessapp/src/main/resources/ # mkdir -p $PACKAGE mkdir -p org/kie/businessapp # cd $WORKING_DIRECTORY/$PROJECTS/$PROJECT_NAME/src/main/resources/$PACKAGE cd ~/jbpm-kogito-home/projects/mybusinessapp/src/main/resources/org/kie/businessapp # touch $FILE_NAME_WITH_EXTENSION… touch process.bpmn dmn.dmn ################################################################################### ############################ # Create Test Scenario asset ############################ # cd $WORKING_DIRECTORY/$PROJECTS/$PROJECT_NAME/src/test/resources/ cd ~/jbpm-kogito-home/projects/mybusinessapp/src/test/resources/ # mkdir -p $PACKAGE mkdir -p org/kie/businessapp # cd $WORKING_DIRECTORY/$PROJECTS/$PROJECT_NAME/src/test/resources/$PACKAGE cd ~/jbpm-kogito-home/projects/mybusinessapp/src/test/resources/org/kie/businessapp # touch $FILE_NAME_WITH_EXTENSION… touch test-scenario.scesim  hosted with ❤ by   The created file can be opened by listing the files in the folder with ls command, hovering over the file name and then “ctrl + click“. Alternatively, you can open the file using GUI by locating the file and clicking on it.  After creating a few assets and modeling simple BPMN process, your project may look like this:   OTHER FILE FORMATS  We don’t provide custom editors in Kogito for any other assets not mentioned above, including work item handlers. However, you can find useful tips on how to create some of them below.  DATA OBJECTS  The Data Object in Business Central is no more than a POJO, so you can create/use it manually:   1. Create a file $CLASS_NAME.java (e.g. Person.java) in src/main/java/$PACKAGE     (e.g. src/main/java/org/kie/businessapp)  2. Create a java class in the file. For example:     package org.kie.businessapp; public class Person {/*...*/}  FORMS  You can create it in Business Central and copy the source code or download the file to your local project, usually to src/main/resources/$PACKAGE (e.g. src/main/resources/org/kie/businessapp).  OTHER ASSETS  You can create any other assets that you need for your project in Business Central and copy the file/source code to VSCode. Another option is obviously to create them from scratch by creating a file with specific extension $FILE_NAME.$EXTENSION (e.g. rules.drl) in desired location (e.g. src/main/resources/org/kie/businessapp).   MIGRATE A PROJECT FROM VSCODE TO BUSINESS CENTRAL  Once you have your project created, you can migrate it to Business Central.  You need to create a repository from the project first. Open the terminal and execute these commands:  # cd $WORKING_DIRECTORY/$PROJECTS/$PROJECT_NAME cd ~/jbpm-kogito-home/projects/mybusinessapp git init git add . git commit -a # Press Insert, write commit message (e.g. Initial commit), press Esc, input :wq and press Enter  hosted with ❤ by   Once you created the repository, import the project to Business Central:   1. Open or Create a space in Business Central  2. Click on the arrow drop-down menu next to the Add Project and click Import     Project  3. Paste the URL to your repository and click Ok     file://$WORKING_DIRECTORY/$PROJECTS/$PROJECT_NAME/.git (e.g.     file:///home/user/jbpm-kogito-home/projects/mybusinessapp/.git)  4. Select the project and click Ok   SYNCHRONIZE CHANGES BETWEEN VSCODE AND BUSINESS CENTRAL  Whether you migrated your projects from Business Central or you created a new one in VSCode from scratch, you might want to synchronize the changes between VSCode and Business Central. You can do it manually using Git since there is no automated way to do that.  The first thing you need to do is to set up a remote repository if you haven’t done so:  # cd $WORKING_DIRECTORY/$PROJECTS/$PROJECT_NAME cd ~/jbpm-kogito-home/projects/mybusinessapp git init git add . git commit -a # Press Insert, write commit message (e.g. Initial commit), press Esc, input :wq and press Enter  hosted with ❤ by   After that, pull or push the changes between Business Central and VSCode. Note, currently VSCode Kogito extension is under alpha release, hence some corner case issues may arise with complex round-trip synchronization. Also, if any conflicts occur, you will need to handle them manually.  ################################################## # Pull the changes from business-central to VSCode ################################################## # git pull business-central $BRANCH_NAME git pull business-central master ################################################## # Push the changes from VSCode to business-central ################################################## git add . git commit -a # Press Insert, write commit message (e.g. Initial commit), press Esc, input :wq and press Enter # git push business-central $BRANCH_NAME git push business-central master  hosted with ❤ by    BUILD AND DEPLOY THE PROJECT  To be able to visualize the process in the runtime monitoring tools, ensure that all processes have their SVGs generated. If you created the project from scratch, you have to generate them manually:   1. Open process in VScode and click SVG icon in the upper right corner.  2. Rename the generated SVG file to the format ${process id}-svg.svg (e.g.     process-svg.svg)     You can find the process id in the Properties panel in the Business Process     editor.   BUILD THE PROJECT  Go to your project home (where pom.xml file is located) and execute the command:  # Build and install project to the local maven repository mvn clean install  hosted with ❤ by   If you are experiencing issues with not resolved dependencies, ensure you have set the right maven repositories. You can also add necessary repositories to the project’s pom.xml file.   DEPLOY THE PROJECT USING SWAGGER  You can deploy your project to any KIE server you want. For demonstration purposes, we will use KIE server which comes alongside with Business Central.  First, ensure the KIE server is running. See “Business Central and KIE server” section above for more information.  Open and login with credentials:  username: kieserver password: kieserver1!  You should get a response: “<response type="SUCCESS" msg="Kie Server info"> ...“  Open and follow the instructions:   1. under “KIE Server and KIE containers” category find:     PUT /server/containers/{containerId} Creates a new KIE container in the KIE     Server with a specified KIE container ID       2. Click PUT and then Try it out  3. Input {containerId} (e.g. containerMyBusinessApp)  4. Update container-id and GAV in body (you can find it in pom.xml of your     project)     For example: containerMyBusinessApp, org.kie.businessapp:mybusinessapp:1.0       5. Click Execute     You should get a successful response with code 201  You can check your containers at   CONCLUSION  I hope this article helped you better understand how to integrate Kogito and Business Central projects. You can seamlessly migrate the existing projects or create a completely new one directly in VSCode. You can now easily start using the Kogito Bundle extension and utilize it to its full potential.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[Part 3 - Example image distribution architecture  In our  from this series we shared a look at the logical common architectural elements found in  point of sale imaging solution for retail stores.    The process was laid out how we've approached the use case and how portfolio solutions are the base for researching a generic architectural blueprint.    It started with laying out the process of how we've approached the use case by researching successful customer portfolio solutions as the basis for a generic architectural blueprint.   Having completed our discussions on the logical view of the blueprint, it's now time to look at a specific example.  This article walks you through an example image distribution scenario showing how expanding the previously discussed elements provides a blueprint for your own point of sale image distribution scenarios.     BLUEPRINTS REVIEW  As mentioned before, the architectural details covered here are base on real solutions using open source technologies. The example scenario presented here is a generic common blueprint that was uncovered researching those solutions. It's our intent to provide a blueprint that provides guidance and not deep technical details.  This section covers the visual representations as presented, but it's expected that they'll be evolving based on future research. There are many ways to represent each element in this architectural blueprint, but we've chosen a format that we hope makes it easy to absorb. Feel free to post comments at the bottom of this post, or  with your feedback.   Now let's take a look at the details in this blueprint and outline the solution.        IMAGE DISTRIBUTION ARCHITECTURE  This example architecture is focused on the solution to deliver images of both point of sale devices as well as store applications across a diverse array of store landscapes in a retail organisation. It's tackling the challenges of standardising how to support both legacy infrastructure needs at the point of sale, as well as positioning a retail organisation for the cloud native development future of their business.    When we talk about store applications we are referring to non-device image applications, for example the ones you could image in the stores supporting stock control, store health and safety, or other retail based activities aside from the point of sale devices.   Starting on the right side of this diagram, the developers and operations work together in their development and testing environments to produce working projects for images and applications. These projects are shown in the source code management (SCM) element as the starting point for delivery to the eventual remote store locations.   From there the project code is sent through the CI / CD platform of choice to ensure it passes all in house tests, compliancy norms, and security levels. This produces an image (or application) that is made available to the image registry for further distribution. Note that we are not outlining any form of tagging or versioning of the images and applications, leaving that for you to apply as your organisation normally works.   A central and important element, the image and data store, pulls the image or application from the image registry. This element makes extensive use of automation and playbooks to ensure the correct distribution of the images and applications to the needed remote store locations. This is also the exit point for our images and applications from the central IT infrastructure, with the next stop being individual store infrastructure.   In each store there is an image and data store cache which receives the images and applications to be distributed throughout the store to the target point of sale devices and other devices for running in store applications.    Each device in a store makes use of two elements, the first being the SKU Catalog which contains stock item information on all the items the store sells. The second is the sales data aggregation element where all the sales information is collected before sending back to the central IT infrastructure.   Back in the central IT infrastructure the sales data aggregation incoming data flow is processes by the sales data integration element which provides integration with the Retail Data Framework blueprint, a separate and detailed architecture blueprint to be covered in another series. Finally, the last central IT element is the SKU Catalog that is used to sync the stock item information between the stores and the back end Retail Data Framework.   The core to point of sales imaging remains a solid fundamental need for infrastructure automation technologies and integration with the supporting Retail Data Framework to ensure the success of this solution.     WHAT'S NEXT  This was just a short overview of the common generic elements that make up our architecture blueprint for the point of sale imaging use case.    An overview of this series on the point of sale portfolio architecture blueprint can be found here:   1.   2.   3.   Catch up on any articles you missed by following one of the links above.   This completes the series and we hope you enjoyed this architecture blueprint for point of sale imaging in retail.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[Context-aware code-completion is one of the most important features an IDE can provide to speed-up coding, reduce typos and avoid other common mistakes. Kogito Tooling 0.9.0 release will bring enhanced code-completion for Literal FEEL expressions:    Look how it helps me realize that I need to use the "string(from)" function if I want to concatenate something to my string. Let’s check these two examples of FEEL expressions:  "2" + 1  The FEEL expression above is evaluated to 3.  "2" + string(1)  While the FEEL expression above is evaluated to "21".  Interesting, isn’t it? 🤓  With some naive enhancements in the FEEL code-completion, users already can avoid the mistake above and concatenate the string as they expect. But now you’re probably wondering how does the magic work, right? It relies on a combination of two elements that power this context-aware FEEL code-completion:   * ANTLR4 (ANother Tool for Language Recognition v4) – generates the parser    based on FEEL grammar  * antlr4-c3 (ANTLR4 Code Completion Core) – provides code-completion candidates    based on ANTLR4 parsed trees (as the image below shows)    With the combination of these tools and a naive implementation, the Literal Boxed expression editor already provides helpful suggestions. In the next Kogito Tooling release, suggestions will be based only on the FEEL functions’ return type and the context’s inferred type.  There’s still room for enhancements in this initial implementation, like considering parameters and other information that those two powerful tools are already providing to us. This feature has a high level of isolation from the rest of the code base, and it’s an excellent starting point for new contributors! 🚀  If you’re wondering about contributing to one of the Kogito Tooling projects 🙂 ping me on Zulip () or in one of the related to this topic, and I will be glad to help! 🙂  The post appeared first on .]]></content>

      <h1>This Week in JBoss - 25 March 2021</h1>
      
    <p class="preamble"></p><p>Welcome to another edition of the JBoss Editorial where we search through the JBoss Community for interesting articles and updates</p><p></p>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_introducing_the_prolific_eric_schabell">Introducing the prolific Eric Schabell</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>If you are a regular reader of the JBoss Editorial  you will be very familiar with the work of Eric Schabell, arguably one of the most prolific writers within the JBoss Community.  This edition is no different and sees Eric product three more articles.</p>
<p>Eric’s first article is a continuation of his Supply Chain Integration Blueprint discussion.  In this article Eric <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2021/03/supply-chain-integration-example-store-integration-architecture.html">expands on the common architectural elements discussed previously and outlines an example Store integration architecture for Supply Chain integration</a>.</p>
<p>Eric’s second article walks us through <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2021/03/codeready-containers-howto-setup-openshift-47-on-local-machine.html">the necessary steps for installing and running the OpenShift Container Platform 4.7 on our local machines</a>.</p>
<p>Eric’s final article kicks off a new series of articles within which he will introduce a new architectural blueprint covering <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2021/03/point-of-sale-an-architectural-introduction.html">"Simplifying and modernizing central management of distributed point-of-sale devices with built in support for container based applications"</a>.</p>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_whats_new_in_kogito_land">What’s new in Kogito land?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>The <a href="http://kie.org">Kogito team</a> have been busy over the last few weeks publishing a number of interesting blog posts covering different aspects of the Kogito ecosystem.</p>
<p>We begin our coverage with an article written by William <a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/03/building-prometheus-dashboards-in-business-central.html">demonstrating how to integrate metrics from a Prometheus datasource into the Business Central</a>.  The article walks you through the process from the creation of the data set within Dashbuilder, building the dashboard, how to consider filtering requirements and how to test the dashboard.</p>
<p>The next article, written by Manaswini, follows on from William’s article and <a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/03/time-series-component-for-dashbuilder.html">demonstrates how you can further extend your dashboard through the integration and visualisation of time series data</a>.</p>
<p>The final article, written by Ricardo, introduces us to Kogito’s support for the <a href="https://github.com/serverlessworkflow/specification/">CNCF Serverless Workflow</a> specification, <a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/03/restful-services-orchestration-with-kogito-and-openapi.html">allowing Kogito to provide a serverless interface to a service which can also be used to orchestrate RESTful services described through the OpenAPI standard</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_clustering_wildfly_using_dns_ping">Clustering WildFly using DNS ping</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>When running within a kubernetes environment it is natural to consider the <a href="http://www.jgroups.org/manual5/index.html#_kube_ping">KUBE_PING protocol</a> for cluster discovery, a protocol relying on the ability to query the kubernetes API server.  If you want to remain agnostic of your environment, or if you do not have sufficient permissions to query the kubernetes API server, then an alternative approach to consider would be the <a href="https://www.wildfly.org//news/2021/03/12/Bootable-jar-jkube-clustering-dns-ping-openshift/">DNS_PING protocol</a> as <a href="https://www.wildfly.org//news/2021/03/12/Bootable-jar-jkube-clustering-dns-ping-openshift/">demonstrated by Yeray using a simple WildFly bootable JAR application</a>.</p>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_optimizing_camel_3_9_no_more_saw_tooth_jvm_garbage_collection">Optimizing Camel 3.9, no more saw tooth JVM garbage collection</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>The upcoming Camel 3.9 release will include some additional, significant improvements in the performance of the internal routing engine leading to a dramatic reduction in object allocation during continuous use.  The Camel team focussed on the five major areas of the codebase they had identified during performance testing with the intention of reducing the allocation count as much as possible, they managed to go one better and achieved a sustained object allocation count of zero!  For more information take a look at <a href="http://www.davsclaus.com/2021/03/apache-camel-39-no-more-saw-tooth-jvm.html">Claus' blog describing the effort</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_monitoring_quarkus_applications_on_openshift">Monitoring Quarkus applications on OpenShift</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>If you are running a Quarkus application on OpenShift you will most likely have a need for integrating with the centralised prometheus instance within the cluster.  This integration is fairly straight forward and can be achieved after following only a few simple steps <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/micrometer-prometheus-openshift/">as ably demonstrated by Jose</a>.</p>

<h2 id="_from_the_community">From the community</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>There’s been a lot of activity since the last editorial so let’s take a look.</p>
<p>First up is Ramon Gordillo’s rather interesting take on moving legacy technology on Kubernetes.
Ramon starts by pointing out that even software that is considered "legacy" and traditionally on-prem is often packed with new and useful features.
Add to that the fact that many containerized applications still rely on legacy systems - "not all apps are greenfield" - and he builds a solid case for doing something that might otherwise induce a few gasps.
Go see how Ramon tackles running IBM DB2 in containers, <a href="https://blog.ramon-gordillo.dev/2021/03/trying-db2-in-kubernetes-for-developers/">Trying DB2 in Kubernetes for developers</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/02/migrating-jbpm-images-secured-by-ldap-to-elytron.html">Migrating jBPM images secured by LDAP to Elytron</a> by Gonzalo Muñoz Fernández is one that I thoroughly enjoyed.
If you’re not familiar with Elytron it is, as Gonzalo explains, Wildfly’s security framework that puts security management and application access into a single subsystem.
In his post, Gonzalo clearly describes and then steps through how to migrate jBPM images from PicketBox, which is a security subsystem based on JAAS login modules, over to Elytron.</p>
<p>Also on the Kogito blog, Paul Brown and Emily Murphy take on the challenge of <a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/03/optimizing-covid-19-vaccination-appointment-scheduling.html">Optimizing COVID-19 vaccination appointment scheduling</a>.
Their post details the approach for using OptaPlanner to handle planning constraints and automatically assign vaccination appointments.
Getting vaccinations rolled out globally is a massive logistical and planning challenge so it’s comforting to know our community is providing tooling to get us all back to "normal".</p>
<p>The Red Hat Developer blog has a couple of recent entries focused on JavaScript that are both good reads.</p>
<p>Michael Dawson introduces us to the <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2021/03/08/introduction-to-the-node-js-reference-architecture-part-1-overview/">Node.js reference architecture from Red Hat and IBM</a> and explains their reasons for creating it.
The goal is to help developers make good choices when navigating the vibrant and extensive JavaScript ecosystem by recommending packages based on shared experience across teams and projects.</p>
<p>Joel Lord takes us through <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2021/03/04/building-rootless-containers-for-javascript-front-ends/">Building rootless containers for JavaScript front ends</a> to demonstrate how you can avoid security vulnerabilities and potential disaster.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<p>Our ever productive Eric Schabell has brought us some fantastic content that should really get you thinking about community technology can apply to solve real world business problems.</p>
<p>Similarly to James and Emily’s post on the Kogito blog, Eric shows how <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2021/03/business-optimisation-architecture-example-vaccine-scheduling-.html">retail pharmacies can optimize scheduling to provide customer vaccinations</a>.</p>
<p>Eric also provides a <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2021/03/supply-chain-integration-an-architectural-introduction.html">architectural blueprint for supply-chain integration</a> that comes with a treasure trove of resources and is well worth delving into.</p>

<h2 id="_highlights_from_the_blogosphere">Highlights from the blogosphere</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>Eric Schabell published a migration guide for a traditional JBoss BPM application running either within a VM or on bare-metal to running inside containers using OpenShift Container Platform.
In <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2021/03/4-easy-steps-for-migrating-projects-to-openshift-container-platform.html">his post he breaks the migration down into four steps</a>.
I won’t detail them all here, but the steps are very easy and you should be able to get up and running quickly on your own laptop, even without having some of the tech installed previously!</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/02/improvements-of-project-authoring-in-business-central.html">Abhishek Kumar discussed project authoring improvements within Business Central recently on the KIE Blog</a>.
The features he discusses are:
. Opening projects directly with a URL
. Changing the default asset page size
. Security permissions for project screen tools and tabs</p>
<p>Each of these help users in the authoring process within Business Central through either ease of use or security!</p>
<p>Still on the KIE Blog, <a href="https://blog.kie.org/2021/01/how-to-use-a-pmml-file-in-dmn-editor-vscode.html">Yeser Amer demonstrates how to use PMML models in the DMN Editor</a>.
PMML support was released with version 0.7.0.
PMML is an XML file describing a predictive model often generated by data mining or AI algorithms.
The support for this format within the VSCode plugin was recently released and follows the same usage patterns as those found within Business Central, so it may very well be familiar to some.</p>
<p>A number of blogs about Quarkus sprang up over the past couple of weeks!</p>
<p>Firstly, Georgios Andrianakis discusses <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/resteasy-reactive-faq/">achieving massive performance without headaches</a> in a RESTEasy application on Quarkus using RESTEasy Reactive.
He talks about the different models, how to use them, the best way to get performance out of each model, and why this will likely becoming the default model within RESTEasy on Quarkus in the near future.</p>
<p>Clement Escoffier <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/getting-started-amqp/">helps us get started with AMQP in Quarkus</a> with an in-depth demo similar to using Kafka.
He walks you through the basics and gives you a running project which he steps through to show you all the basics.</p>
<p>Over on the Red Hat Developers Blog, Eric Deandrea shows us a very cool trick, or maybe the power of Quarkus’s Spring compatibility, about running a Spring Boot application on Quarkus without changing a single line of Java code!
It is definitely worth the read, <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2021/02/09/spring-boot-on-quarkus-magic-or-madness/">head on over to check it out</a>!</p>
<p>If you missed the announcement about Quarkus remote development, be sure to read up about it by Daniel Oh <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2021/02/11/enhancing-the-development-loop-with-quarkus-remote-development/">on the Red Hat Developer Blog</a>.
Using a mutable-jar package, you can deploy onto OpenShift and continue to develop remotely without having to build a new container and push every time you want to see a change!
What an amazing way to build on the cloud and make sure everything works correctly without having slow downs!</p>
<p>Yeray Borges of the Wildfly team <a href="https://www.wildfly.org/news/2021/02/01/Bootable-jar-jkube-clustering-openshift/">demonstrates how to deploy a bootable Wildfly application jar which caches the HTTP session state</a>.
It’s a useful option allowing you to build and test locally and then push to OpenShift with minimal changes ensuring your application still works in the cloud.</p>
<p>Lastly, Mario Fusco and Edson Yanaga have a presentation from a recent DevNation Live about designing a Java API.
Check it out over on <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/devnation/tech-talks/design-java-apis">the Red Hat Developer blog</a>.
Certainly worth the watch if you develop APIs in Java (which should be most of you).</p>

      <h1>This Week in JBoss - 28 January 2021</h1>
      
    <p class="preamble"></p><p>Hello! Welcome to another edition of the JBoss Editorial that brings you news and updates from our community.</p><p></p>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_releases">Releases!!</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>Infinispan 12 release, codenamed <code>Lockdown</code>, brings a ton of new features and improvements.
Indexing and querying capabilities have seen a number of improvements with the help of Hibernate Search integration.
ProtoStream marshalling is upgraded with a new <code>@ProtoAdapter</code> annotation that lets you easily integrate third-party classes.
It’s a pretty elegant solution to what could present itself as a real headache for developers.
Speaking of marshalling improvements, Infinispan 12 also makes your life easier by automatically generating and registering <code>SerializationContextInitializer</code> implementations to marshall user types.
Also notable is the SPI for cross-site replication merge conflicts, which continues on the brilliant work that team has done to provide a solution for ensuring data integrity.
There’s a lot going on in Infinispan 12 and probably too much to try and sum up here so why not head over and read all the details in the <a href="https://infinispan.org/blog/2021/01/25/infinispan-12-final">Infinispan 12.0.0.Final Announcement</a>.</p>
<p>Congratulations to the entire Infinispan team on all the hard work.</p>
<p><a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/quarkus-1-11-0-final-released/">Quarkus 1.11</a> is here!
This release brings you RESTEasy Reactive, which is a new JAX-RS implementation for writing RESTful services.
Quarkus 1.11 also introduces the Dev UI so you can quickly visualize all your loaded extensions, access docs, and more.
Of course there are other things in Quarkus 1.11 but RESTEasy Reactive and the Dev UI look to be quite promising indeed.</p>
<p>The Quarkus team keep things rolling with the release of <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/intellij-quarkus-tools-1.3.0/">Quarkus Tools for IntelliJ 1.3.0</a> that adds codestarts to the Quarkus project wizard.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.keycloak.org//2021/01/keycloak-1202-released.html">Keycloak 12.0.2</a> is now available too!

      <h1>This Week in JBoss: 14 January 2021</h1>
      
    <p class="preamble"></p><p>Welcome to the first installment of our JBoss Editorial for 2021! And to start the year, we have a brand new major release of the core product of the JBoss community! Yes, Wildfly 22 is out!</p><p></p>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_wildfly_22_and_camel_3_7">Wildfly 22 and Camel 3.7</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>Yes! We have a brand new major version of Wildfly! <a href="https://www.wildfly.org/news/2021/01/13/WildFly22-Final-Released/">Wildfly 22 is out!</a>.</p>
<p>This release includes support for use of log4j2 in applications, new base health and metrics subsystems to provide server observability for users who don’t need the application instrumentation that comes with MicroProfile Health and Metrics, and a number of other features related to management, provisioning, messaging and security. Plus numerous bug fixes, enhancements and component upgrades.</p>
<p>On top of that, there is also an updated version of the new tech-preview WildFly Preview distribution. This will allow the community have a look at what Wildfly developers are doing for Jakarta EE 9 support, along with other changes in the server architecture that are expected to appear later in 2021.</p>
<p>Wildfly 22 is already a nice treat, but we also have <a href="https://camel.apache.org/blog/2020/12/Camel37-Whatsnew/">Camel 3.7</a>, which also quite exciting, and fortunately for all of us, Claus Ibsen has published a review of what he called <a href="http://www.davsclaus.com/2020/12/apache-camel-37-lts-released-fastest.html">the fastest Camel ever!</a> So, go check it out if you want to know more about this camel release.</p>

<h2 id="_tech_bytes">Tech bytes</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>A few interesting technical articles came out in the last weeks, so we’ll try to catch you up with three of them here. First, we have an excellent one from Bela Ban on <a href="http://belaban.blogspot.com/2020/12/running-jgroups-raft-as-service.html">running JGroups raft as a service</a>. It’s very hands on post, focusing on getting everything running. Then we have a longer walkthrough to let you experiment on <a href="https://blog.ramon-gordillo.dev/2020/12/spring-boot-embedded-cache-with-infinispan-in-kubernetes/">using Spring boot embedded cache with Infinispan on Kubernetes</a>. Certainly, worth a look, isn’t it? The last one is, of course, on Quarkus, because Quarkus is, as it should, all the rage lately. In this article, Clément Escoffier took the time to explain some of the <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/magic-control">magic beneath Quarkus and Vert.x</a> and why this is the kind magic you to have as a developer.</p>

<h2 id="_evangelists_corner">Evangelist’s Corner</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>As always, our very own Eric Schabell has been busy in the few last weeks and released a steady stream of new content. First, he published <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2021/01/codeready-containers-installing.html">part4 - Installing business automation operator</a> of his series on CodeReady containers. He then revisited the <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2020/12/codeready-containers-exploring-home-loan-mortgage-process.html">Home loan mortgage process using CodeReady Containers</a>.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[
      <article class="" data-tags="Christmas, 2020">
      <h1>This Week in JBoss: 25 December 2020</h1>
      <p>I’m writing this on Christmas Day and have spent the last week or so thinking about what I should put
into my traditional 25th of December entry. Then it came to me in that "lightbulb moment": I’d replicate,
more or less, what I said to my entire team/org before I went on vacation a few days earlier. It’s a summary
of the year and I think it’s relevant for our wider community too. So here it is in a slightly modified form …​</p>
<p>I wanted to spend a few minutes thanking you all for the work and interactions you’ve done over this testing year!
I don’t think anyone could have predicted 2020 at the start of the year and I think it’s fair to say that every one of us
has been affected in one way or another. Yet if you look back on the year and the accomplishments we’ve achieved
as a community, you could be forgiven for thinking this was a normal year!</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Making Quarkus available to all OpenShift customers, which we announced at KubeCon, as well as continuing the innovation within
(e.g., Hibernate Reactive, RESTeasy Reactive);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Knative/Serverless, where we now have 7 Working Group leads out of 15 in the Knative community, we also added Functions to OpenShift Serverless;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More and more of our technologies become available to Kube developers;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We continued our close involvement with AdoptOpenJDK (aka Eclipse Adoptium), helping to push it to even greater heights;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So many great innovations continued around efforts such as Kogito, Strimzi, Camel-K, Eclipse Vert.x, Infinispan, …​</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We all managed to host, attend, present at countless virtual conferences, workshops and Red Hat Summit; probably enough to realise what
we’re all missing from the real things!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eclipse MicroProfile 4.0 and Eclipse Jakarta EE 9.0 both come to life;</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>The list could go on and on (e.g., EAP XD, OptaPlanner, …) but my point isn’t so much to call out the successes that this
community have helped to drive but rather to illustrate that we were able to do these and more at all! In the
climate of 2020, retaining the kind of focus we have and continuing to go above and beyond, as many of you and the teams
have, is a testament to Red Hat and our communities, our culture and the supporting bonds you’ve all built up and nurtured. For that
alone I thank you and you should all be incredibly proud!</p>
<p>With that in mind, whether or not you celebrate Christmas or intend to take extended time away, make sure you do take time
to rest and recharge. Be with your friends and family as much as you can given the continuing Covid situation. Find time to unwind
but also congratulate yourself on coming together in 2020 and delivering so much to our communities, partners and customers. I’m not
even going to try to predict what 2021 will be like but if we can replicate what we’ve been able to do in 2020, I’m sure
we’ll all come through it stronger and together!</p>

      <h1>This Week in JBoss - 17 December 2020</h1>
      
    <p class="preamble"></p><p>Welcome to another installment of our JBoss Editorial and last before the holidays! As always during this period of the year, we all rush to finish our ongoing tasks so that we can enjoy a bit of rest. And the projects of the JBoss community do the same, which means we have quite of lot to discuss today! So, without any further ado…​</p><p></p>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_quarkus_and_resteasy_reactive">Quarkus and RestEasy Reactive</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>The last months have certainly been quite active for Quarkus. Now part of the portfolio of <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/cloud-native-apps/what-is-quarkus">Red Hat products</a>, the project has everything but slow down. Just last week a new release, <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/quarkus-1-10-3-final-released/">Quarkus 1.10.3</a> was published, but also RestEasy announced a large refactoring of its project <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/resteasy-reactive/">RestEasy Reactive</a> in order to integrate and support Quarkus even more. Alessio Soldano, one of the main developers of RestEasy, also shares his thoughts behind this project <a href="https://resteasy.github.io/2020/12/07/resteasy-reactive/">here</a>.</p>
<p>But that’s not all in the Quarkiverse! Andy Damevin released an interesting article on link:But that’s not all in the Quarkus-verse! Andy Damevin released an interesting article on new ways to discover Quarkus <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/extension-codestarts-a-new-way-to-learn-and-discover-quarkus/"> new ways to discover Quarkus using Extension codestarts</a>. Whether that you already know Quarkus or want to explore it for the first time, this one will be in any case quite interesting to you! Oh, and by the way Quarkiverse is by no means a "bon mot,” it’s the real thing: <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/quarkiverse/">Quarkiverse Hub - Home of Community Extensions</a>, so go check out this article from George Gastaldi to know more about it!</p>
<p>Last, but certainly not the least, another article will help you <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/12/08/spring-boot-to-quarkus-migrations-and-more-in-red-hats-migration-toolkit-for-applications-5-1-0/">migrating your Spring Boot app to Quarkus using the Red Hat migration toolkit</a>.</p>

</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_apache_avro_and_apicurio_registry">Apache Avro and Apicurio Registry</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>Avro and Apicurio got a lot of attention in the last weeks. First, Clément Escoffier, who already took the time to blog about <a href="">How to Use Kafka, Schema Registry and Avro with Quarkus</a> a few months ago, just released a new article on <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/avro-native/">Using Avro in a native executable</a>. Hugo Guerrero also took a stab at the topic in his blog entry on <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/12/11/debezium-serialization-with-apache-avro-and-apicurio-registry/">Debezium serialization with Apache Avro and Apicurio Registry</a>.</p>

<p>With the end of 2020 coming up soon, it’s time to clean up our desk and prepare a clean slate for next year.

      <h1>This week in JBoss - 20th November 2020</h1>
      
    <p class="preamble"></p><p><em>Welcome to another installment of our JBoss Editorial! Today, we’ll focus on some core project of our community. The first one is obviously Wildfly, our Jakarta EE application server whom predecessor (JBoss AS) was the beginning of everything. The second one is our more recent and shiny project, Quarkus. Without any further ado, let’s begin!</em></p><p></p>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_wildfly_a_first_taste_of_jakarta_9">Wildfly, a first Taste of Jakarta 9</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>With the release of the <a href="https://wildfly.org//news/2020/11/19/WildFly2101-Released/">Wildfly 21.01</a>, it’s time to put the Jakarta EE server back in the spotlight. Especially as this release gives a <a href="https://www.wildfly.org//news/2020/11/12/Jakarta-EE-9-with-WildFly-Preview/">a preview of Jakarta EE 9</a>! And if your knowledge of the EE standards needs a refresher to fully enjoy this preview, we got you covered with this in depth two-part series on <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/06/15/jakarta-ee-multitenancy-with-jpa-on-wildfly-part-1/">Jakarta EE multitenancy (part1)</a> and <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/11/12/jakarta-ee-multitenancy-with-jpa-on-wildfly-part-2/">(part 2)</a>.</p>
<p>But Jakarta EE 9 is not the only newsworthy item around Wildfly. The first part of my own series on <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/11/06/wildfly-server-configuration-with-ansible-collection-for-jcliff-part-1/">automation of Wildfly using Ansible and JCliff</a> is out! It’s hand on a tutorial on how to set up Ansible and its decided collection for Wildfly (<a href="https://github.com/wildfly-extras/ansible_collections_jcliff">JCliff</a>) in order to fully automate the app server set up and configuration.</p>

<h2 id="_quarkus_leading_the_future_of_java">Quarkus, Leading the Future of Java</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>It might a bold statement, but we’ve made it! Or rather Red Hat made it as Quarkus 1.7 is available as a product for a little while now. Maybe it’s time to finally take a look at it by following this <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/11/10/leading-the-future-of-java-with-the-red-hat-build-of-quarkus-1-7/">Red Hat Quarkus tutorial</a>?</p>
<p>This is also a perfect opportunity to explore Quarkus functionality and ecosystems. For instance, take a look at this interesting post on <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/mutiny-invoke-and-call/">mutiny invoke and call</a>. Or simply explore the cloud readiness of the framework with this article on <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/11/13/how-i-built-a-serverless-blog-search-with-java-quarkus-and-aws-lambda/">building a serverless blog search with Quarkus and AWS lambda</a> and this <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/introducing-quarkus-red-hat-openshift?sc_cid=701f2000000tyBjAAI">introduction to Quarkus on Red Hat Openshift</a>?</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_techbytes">Techbytes</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>If Quarkus and Wildfly did not quench your thirst for knowledge, let us give you a bit more nuggets. First, why not explore the topic of <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/11/09/openid-connect-integration-with-red-hat-3scale-api-management-and-okta/">using OpenID connect integration with 3scale</a>? Or maybe <a href="http://wei-meilin.blogspot.com/2020/11/contract-first-development-event-driven.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+blogspot%2FhFXzh+%28Christina+%E7%9A%84+J%E8%80%81%E9%97%86%29">contract first development using an event-driven approach with Kafka, AMQ Streams, APIcurio</a>? And to make it extra spicy, Christina has even a added a touch of Google protobuf! By the way, if "event driven" is your thing, you can then move this other article on <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/11/17/event-driven-serverless-applications-with-camel-k/">event driven serverless with Camel K</a>.</p>
<p>Still hungry for more? Well, maybe it’s time for less crunchy and technical details? What about stepping back and invite some reflection on <a href="http://www.ofbizian.com/2020/11/open-source-monetization-ecosystem.html">Open Source monetization ecosystem</a>.</p>

<p>In case you somehow missed above (most likely by jumping directly to this section) …​ <a href="https://wildfly.org//news/2020/11/19/WildFly2101-Released/">Wildlfy 21 Alpha 1 has been released</a>!</p>

<p>All this Java made you too jittery? Time for a Java break? Here are a few dry cookies to go along your cup of joe. As mentioned above, the first part of my series on using [Ansible to automate Wildfly setup] might a nice palate cleanser. Also, if you are using Docker you might be interested in this article describing how to <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/11/19/transitioning-from-docker-to-podman/">transitioning from Docker to Podman</a>.</p>

      <h1>This Week in JBoss - 30 September 2020</h1>
      <p>It’s that time again where we round up the latest news from the community…</p>
<p>Are you looking to develop projects on your local machine, and push them on to a real OpenShift Container Platform, without having to worry about cloud hosting of your container platform?
In this <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2020/09/how-to-setup-openshift-container-platform-45.html">post</a> Eric Schabell provides an easy way to get up and running with CodeReady containers on your own development machine.
He’s automated most of the process through scripts, and guides you through the rest of the process.
Eric also shows you how to drop into the Developer console in OCP providing a developer focused view that hides much of the plumbing that is not needed during development.</p>
<p>In this <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/09/28/call-an-existing-rest-service-with-apache-camel-k/">post</a> Mary Cochran shows us a simple way to connect existing services together using CamelK via each service’s REST APIs.
Mary gets deep into the details providing code examples and commands to get you up and running.</p>
<p>Eric Schabell continues his <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2020/09/financial-payments-architecture-an-introduction.html">blog series</a>, bringing you architectural blueprints for&nbsp;cloud-native financial payment services.
The blueprints are focused on proven interactions, messaging, processing, and integration patterns that you can put to use when building a cloud-native payment architecture.
This week he covers the <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2020/09/payments-architecture-common-elements.html">Common Architecture Elements</a> that make up the architecture, and gets into some details with the <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2020/09/payments-architecture-immediate-payments-example.html">Immediate Payments Example</a>.</p>
<p>As is normal for this time of year, the conference season is beginning to kick off.
Albeit this year in a virtual arena.
Undoubtedly this is an unfortunate situation for those that enjoy the in-person events.
However, it’s great for accessibility and reach allowing many more people across to globe to attend.
DevConf.US 2020 is one such event.
It’s a free, Red Hat sponsored technology conference for community project and professional contributors to Free and Open Source technologies.
Read more <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2020/09/devconfus-2020-appdev-containerization-ask-the-experts.html">here</a> where Eric describes the “AppDev &amp; Containerization Ask the Experts” Panels that he and Kurt Stam  will be moderating.</p>
<p>This week Kapil Shukla explains how to <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/09/28/build-a-data-streaming-pipeline-using-kafka-streams-and-quarkus/">build a data streaming pipeline using Kafka Streams and Quarkus</a>.
In this post Kapil shows how data can be processed in real-time as and when it arrives, instead of being batch processed as was needed in the past.</p>
<p>In this <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/09/22/troubleshooting-user-task-errors-in-red-hat-process-automation-manager-and-red-hat-jboss-bpm-suite/">Post</a> Anton Giertli provides help with troubleshooting user task errors in Red Hat Process Automation Manager and Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite.
If you are a developer working with user tasks and having trouble debugging them, this post might well help you out.</p>
<p>With the recent release of Apache Camel VS Code extension (0.0.27) comes several new language support features for Apache Camel.
Read this <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/09/18/new-language-support-features-in-apache-camel-vs-code-extension-0-0-27/">post</a> to learn more.</p>

      <h1>This Week in JBoss - 16 September 2020</h1>
      <p>Welcome to another edition of the JBoss Editorial where we gather news from our communities and explore developments from our projects.</p>
<p>Our very own Mark Little goes into detail to explain Quarkus and Jakarta EE compatibility. Mark gives an insightful breakdown of the history for both projects and answers a much asked question, will Quarkus and Jarkata EE come together? No spoilers here, though. Go read Mark’s <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/09/11/quarkus-and-jakarta-ee-together-or-not/">Quarkus and Jakarta EE: Together, or not?</a> if you already haven’t.</p>
<p>In the evangelist’s corner, Eric Schabell has brought out an excellent <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2020/09/beginners-guide-to-decision-management-retail-web-shop.html">hands-on workshop with labs</a> for Red Hat Decision Manager that show you how to design and build a retail web shop from scratch.</p>
<p>Eric also teams up with Ramon Villarreal to bring you architectural blueprints for <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2020/09/financial-payments-architecture-an-introduction.html">cloud-native financial payment services</a>. The blueprints are focused on proven interactions, messaging, processing, and integration patterns that you can put to use when building a cloud-native payment architecture.</p>
<p>Leon Matthews continues the topic of all things financial with his analysis of the history of Java in the banking sector and the role Quarkus is playing in allowing banks and financial institutions to embrace change, innovate to remain competitive, and become more efficient. Read Leon’s post: <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/25-years-and-going-strong-why-java-matters-future-banks?source=bloglisting">25 years and going strong: Why Java matters to the future of banks</a>.</p>
<p>Speaking of Quarkus, Clement Escoffier shows you how to build a stream of beer and then retrieve beers in a reactive way. After walking you through how you can do that with Mutiny, Clement provides a gist with all the code that you can compile and execute with jbang and a single command. You can find everything in his <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/mutiny-pagination/">Handling paginated APIs with Mutiny</a> post.</p>
<p>Another post from the Quarkus team that is worth reading is Jeff Beck’s <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/wipro-customer-story/">Wipro Addresses Seismic Shift in Retail with Quarkus</a>. Jeff shares the Wipro story by describing their needs and challenges and how they adopted Quarkus to modernize their applications and address customer use cases.</p>
<p>If it hasn’t crossed your radar, Bela Ban shows us his plans for a <a href="http://belaban.blogspot.com/2020/09/one-size-fits-all-jgroups.html">One Size Fits All JGroups</a> program and explains what is needed to get there.</p>
<p>Jakub Scholz on the Strimzi team shares a post that looks at using the <a href="https://strimzi.io/blog/2020/09/01/enforce-custom-resource-policies-with-opa-gatekeeper/">Open Policy Agent Gatekeeper project to enforce policies when creating custom resources</a> and demonstrates how this is useful. While the post focuses on Strimzi, Jakub points out how Gatekeeper can be used with other projects so go take a look.</p>
<p>Releases!!</p>
<p>Congratulations to the Infinispan team for releasing the Dev03 cut of Infinispan 12. Cross-site replication capabilities continue to advance with an SPI that includes configurable policies for merging conflicting values from asynchronous backups, a feature which guarantees data consistency between global Infinispan clusters. That’s no small feat of engineering! Find out about that and more over on the <a href="https://infinispan.org/blog/2020/09/08/infinispan-12/">Infinispan blog</a>.</p>
<p>Quarkus 1.8 is out with some shiny new features, including jbang integration for easy Quarkus-based scripting, support for multiple persistence units for the Hibernate ORM extension, a new Micrometer extension, and update to GraalVM 20.2 for building native apps from Quarkus projects. Here is the <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/quarkus-1-8-0-final-released/">announcement with all the info</a>.</p>
<p>Keycloak have announced their new Account Console, built on React and PatternFly 4. The latest version offers a fresher look and feel with custom themes and extensions. Go <a href="https://www.keycloak.org/2020/09/new-account-console.adoc">check it out</a>.</p>

      <h1>JBoss Weekly Editorial 27 August 2020</h1>
      
    <p class="preamble"></p><p>Welcome to another edition of the JBoss Weekly Editorial!
Summer is drawing to a close, but that doesn’t mean Red Hat has been resting, or that nothing has been happening over the past two weeks.
There’s been some great movement and progress made, which we’ll cover.
In this edition we’re going to focus on OpenShift, the blogosphere, and finally, other project news.</p><p></p>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_openshift">OpenShift</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>Last week was KubeCon Europe 2020, which as you can guess, was a big event for OpenShift!
We had 15 speakers from Red Hat speaking over the three days, giving 17 talks.
A number of new announcements, blog posts, and articles came out during KubeCon Europe 2020, They’re all liked at <a href="https://www.openshift.com/kubecon">the OpenShift event page</a>.
There’s simply too many to link here.
The above event page has videos, press release links, links to other announcements and blogs.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_blogs">Blogs</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>Continuing the trend about OpenShift, Paul Vergilis wrote about external clients and Red Hat AMQ over at the <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/08/26/connecting-external-clients-to-red-hat-amq-broker-on-red-hat-openshift/">Red Hat Developer blog</a>.
If you’re interested in getting started with Strimzi, Apache Kafka on Kubernetes, you’ll want to catch up on the blog post Paolo Patierno and Jakub Scholz wrote: <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/08/14/introduction-to-strimzi-apache-kafka-on-kubernetes-kubecon-europe-2020/">Introduction to Strimzi: Apache Kafka on Kubernetes (KubeCon Europe 2020)</a>.
For those of you running OpenJDK 8, you’ll want to know more about JDK Flight Recorder available in OpenJDK 8u262. An indepth intro is available at the <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/08/25/get-started-with-jdk-flight-recorder-in-openjdk-8u/">Red Hat Developer Blog</a> written by Mario Torre.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_projects">Projects</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>To wrap up this edition, we will be looking at two announcements from Keycloak:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.keycloak.org//2020/08/keycloak-1101-released.html">Keycloak 11.0.1 released</a> - fixing seven bugs</p>

      <h1>This Week in JBoss - 13 August 2020</h1>
      
    <p class="preamble"></p><p>Welcome to another edition of the JBoss Editorial where we gather news from our communities and explore developments from our projects.</p><p></p>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_jgroups_5">JGroups 5!</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>Exciting news from Bela Ban as <a href="http://belaban.blogspot.com/2020/08/jgroups-500final-released.html">JGroups 5.0.0.Final</a> is released. JGroups 5 brings lots of improvements and some major API changes.</p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest change is that <a href="http://www.jgroups.org/manual5/index.html#Message"><code>Message</code></a> is now an interface with a number of subclasses that perform late marshalling so object payload is serialized at the point when messages are sent, which eliminates a memory allocation and makes JGroups performance even better.</p>
<p>Other cool features in JGroups 5 are <a href="http://belaban.blogspot.com/2020/07/double-your-performance-virtual-threads.html">virtual thread support</a>, an implementation of the Random Early Drop (RED) protocol, more efficient FD_ALL3 failure detection, a new protocol to dump stats, and lots more.</p>
<p>Hearty congratulations to Bela and all the contributors and folks who made it happen!!</p>
<p>Head over to the <a href="http://www.jgroups.org/manual5/index.html">JGroups 5 documentation</a> and find out more.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_keycloak_tech_talk">Keycloak Tech Talk</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>Stian Thorgersen of the Keycloak team presents a DevNation Tech Talk that provides an in-depth look at the best open-source identity and management solution around. Stian gives a great demo of Keycloak that not only highlights features but showcases just how easy it is to integrate and use Keycloak capabilities to secure your applications.</p>
<p>Spend half an hour and let Stian dazzle you with <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/08/07/a-deep-dive-into-keycloak/">A deep dive into Keycloak</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_reactive_quarkus_a_java_mutiny">Reactive Quarkus: A Java Mutiny</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>Another Tech Talk that you should definitely check out comes from Clement Escoffier and Edson Yanaga, who go into detail about Mutiny, a new reactive programming library. Clement and Edson explain why reactive matters, how Mutiny is makes it easier to develop reactive applications, and how the library is integrated with Quarkus.</p>
<p>Listen to Clement and Edson deliver their excellent talk, <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/08/07/reactive-quarkus-a-java-mutiny/">Reactive Quarkus: A Java Mutiny</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_skupper_and_the_hybrid_cloud">Skupper and the Hybrid Cloud</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>By now I’m sure you’ve heard of <a href="https://skupper.io/">Skupper</a> but maybe have yet to see it in action. Ted Ross gives a great introduction and live demonstration of Skupper across AWS, GCP, and Azure that shows real-time load balancing and fail-over.</p>
<p>Watch Ted’s <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/08/10/kubernetes-and-the-hybrid-cloud-with-skupper/">Kubernetes and the hybrid cloud with Skupper</a> Tech Talk today. You won’t regret it.</p>

<h2 id="_in_the_community">In the Community</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>Katia Aresti has created a pretty awesome Infinispan Server tutorial that demonstrates a full set of capabilities with a weather application. Visit the <a href="https://infinispan.org/infinispan-server-tutorial/">Infinispan Remote Weather App Tutorial</a> and try it for yourself.</p>
<p>Jakub Scholz on the Strimzi team has written a comprehensive blog post, <a href="https://strimzi.io/blog/2020/08/05/using-open-policy-agent-with-strimzi-and-apache-kafka/">Using Open Policy Agent with Strimzi and Apache Kafka</a>, that explores support for Kafka authorization using Open Policy Agent.</p>

    <p class="preamble"></p><p>Welcome to another installment of our JBoss Editorial! The last two weeks have been pretty rich on published content and releases, so let’s dive right in!</p><p></p>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_from_spring_boot_to_quarkus">From Spring Boot to Quarkus</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>As Quarkus community is increasing the question of how to migrate to this new framework (or rather runtime) often arises. If you happen to have such predicament with Spring Boot, I’m sure you’ll be quite interested to read this article on <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/07/17/migrating-spring-boot-tests-to-quarkus/">migrating Spring Boot tests to Quarkus</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_secure_vue_js_with_keycloak">Secure vue.js with Keycloak</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>If most of the content we mentioned today is made of articles, we have one, quite cool video content to share. It’s coming straight from one of the tech-talks of the DevNation and we hope you’ll like it :  <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/devnation/tech-talks/secure-vuejs-keycloak">Secure vue.js using Keycloak</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_jgroups_double_your_performance_with_virtual_threads">JGroups: Double your performance with virtual threads!</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>Quite a lot of exciting things are happening in the realm of JGroups lately! Last time, we already mentioned the <a href="http://belaban.blogspot.com/2020/06/new-netty-transport.html">new netty transport</a>, but Bela Ban, the creator of project, got us even more excited with this news about <a href="http://belaban.blogspot.com/2020/07/double-your-performance-virtual-threads.html">how one can double its performance using virtual threads (fibers) on JDK15/16</a>!!! This JDK is still a bit down the road, but its certainly a nice glimpse into tomorrow.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_back_to_the_basics">Back to the Basics</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>As said above, the last two weeks have been particularly rich in interesting content around the JBoss community and the Java ecosystem at large. Some of those articles took the time to go back and rethink some aspects of our work that we take for granted. Let’s first mention this original take on java programming that focuses on <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/07/09/behavior-is-easy-state-is-hard-tame-inconsistent-state-in-your-java-code/">taming inconsistent state in a Java code</a>.</p>
<p>This first article is already pretty centered around coding, but this next one goes into the very guts of Infinispan! If you know the project, I’m sure you’ll find this entry on <a href="https://infinispan.org/blog/2020/07/22/anchored-keys/">anchored keys</a> as fascinating as I did!</p>
<p>Let’s also revisit a classic: load balancing a JEE app server (such as Wildfly or its product counterpart JBoss EAP), but with a twist: <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/07/15/load-balancing-red-hat-jboss-enterprise-application-platform-subclusters-with-mod_cluster/">Load balancing Red Hat JBoss EAP with subclusters</a>.</p>

<h2 id="_evangelists_corner">Evangelist’s Corner</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>No rest for the wicked! And no, no rest for our very own Eric D. Schabell! In the last two weeks, he has been quite busy again. First of all, he got his very <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2020/07/what-the-dev-podcast-episode-44-agile-integration.html">first interview on a podcast</a> (yep, that’s right, he was never on a podcast before!). With the host, he discussed the best practices for Agile integration. If you are interested in this topic, fetch the episode, you won’t regret it!</p>
<p>That’s not all. Eric also took the time to update and release his "fully updated to the latest release" version of his <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2020/07/beginners-guide-building-a-retail-web-shop-workshop-update.html">Beginners guide - Building a retail web shop workshop update</a>.</p>
<p>On top of that, he took the time to describe <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2020/07/how-to-install-rhpam-77.html">how to How to Install Red Hat Process Automation Manager 7.7</a> and share his experience with the <a href="https://www.schabell.org/2020/07/shift-remote-2020-devops-heroes.html">Shift Remote 2020 online conference</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_releases_releases_releases">Releases, releases, releases,…​</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>As always, the JBoss community has been pretty busy in the last weeks and a few projects have seized the relative quietness of Summer to release new version of their product:</p>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_decaf">Decaf</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>For once, this section stays rather close to Java, covering how to <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/07/27/deploy-your-java-web-application-into-the-cloud-using-eclipse-jkube/">deploy your Java Webapp into the cloud using Eclipse JKube</a>.

      <h1>This Week in JBoss - 9 July 2020: Over the (j)cliff!</h1>
      
    <p class="preamble"></p><p>Welcome to another installment of our JBoss Editorial! Summer has begun, well, at least for those of you readers living in the northern hemisphere :)! So let’s enjoy it by giving some nice, interesting and exciting reading material to enjoy while resting in the sun (with your mask, #staysafe!).</p><p></p>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_infinispan_11">Infinispan 11!</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>It’s out! The new major version of Infinispan is here! Please go and check out <a href="https://infinispan.org/blog/2020/07/03/infinispan-11/">Infinispan 11</a>!</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_jgroups_new_netty_transport">JGroups: new Netty transport!</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>I’ve said it many times, JGroups is an incredible piece of software. The power and the flexibility of the frameworks always dazzle me, so I’m very excited about this <a href="http://belaban.blogspot.com/2020/06/new-netty-transport.html">new netty transport</a> getting into it!</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_ansible_collection_for_jcliff">Ansible Collection for JCliff</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>It’s a pet project of mine that I have already mentioned a few months ago: Andrew Block, Roel Holzmans and I have been working on integrating further Widlfy (and EAP) into Ansible, in order to ensure that one can use the tool to fine-tune as much as possible the JEE server’s configuration. We leverage an existing Open Source Java tool called <a href="https://github.com/bserdar/jcliff">JCliff</a> to just that.</p>
<p>Last year, we released a role, already available in <a href="https://galaxy.ansible.com/redhat-cop/jcliff">Ansible Galaxy</a>, to integrate JCliff into Ansible. However, since then, the Ansible community released a new format to distribute extension, called Ansible Collection. We therefore decide to migrate our content there and we finally released, just this week, a very first version: <a href="https://galaxy.ansible.com/redhat/jcliff">Ansible Collection for JCliff 0.0.1</a>.</p>
<p>So, please check it out! All you need to do is $ ansible-galaxy collection install redhat.jcliff:0.0.1 and, voilà, the collection is installed and you can start to <a href="https://github.com/ansible-middleware/ansible_collections_jcliff_demo">play with it</a>.</p>
<p>Oh, almost forgot! This release also supports, on tops of Linux, MacOSX with homebrew! (Windows using Chocolatey is coming next).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_serverless_and_microservice">Serverless and Microservice</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>As alluring as “serverless” is, it does, like any other technology, come with its own challenges. Follow Christina as she goes through the importance of having the proper infrastructure to support your “serverless” apps in this well thought out blog entry: <a href="http://wei-meilin.blogspot.com/2020/07/serverless-integration-components.html">Serverless Integration Components</a></p>
<p>Follow this first read, you may want to take a look at this other article on <a href="http://www.ofbizian.com/2020/07/operators-and-sidecars-are-new-model.html">operators and sidecars are the new model</a>, which also discuss similar concerns.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_microprofile">Microprofile</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>With the release JBoss EAP XP, there are a lot of opportunities to develop supported microprofile application. So if you want to explore how to develop such an application, please follow <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/author/ehugonne/">Emmanuel Hugonnet</a>’s tutorial on <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/07/01/develop-eclipse-microprofile-applications-on-red-hat-jboss-enterprise-application-platform-expansion-pack-1-0-with-red-hat-codeready-workspaces/">Develop Eclipse MicroProfile applications on Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform Expansion Pack 1.0 with Red Hat CodeReady Workspaces</a>.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<p>Yeah, I know, we just talked about Ansible! Where is my Java stuff you are rightly asking. Well, as you’ll see Ansible, while being Python, plays well with Java software, as demonstrated by this article on <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/07/03/automate-workshop-setup-with-ansible-playbooks-and-codeready-workspaces/">automate workshop setup with Ansible playbooks and CodeReady workspaces</a>.</p>

      <h1>This Week in JBoss: 26 June 2020</h1>
      <p>Here we are, once again at the close of June.
Another summer has begun, albeit a little different than most.
I hope everyone is safe, healthy, and doing well.
There have been some very interesting blogs posted in the past couple of weeks that we’ll discuss in this edition, as well as a few releases.</p>
<p>Operators in Kubernetes provide an extension point for the platform.
They follow a pattern allowing you to manage resources and applications within the cluster.
An operator can be either namespace-scoped or cluster-scoped.
Did you know, however, that you can convert between the two?
That is exactly what Abhishek Koserwal details in six steps over on the <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/06/26/migrating-a-namespace-scoped-operator-to-a-cluster-scoped-operator/">Red Hat Developer blog</a>.
Abhishek walks you through a basic example and provides the full example as a GitHub repo.
Read the article for more information, and reasons why you may want or need to switch between the different scopes.</p>
<p>Multitenancy may be something you deal with everyday, or it may be something you’re looking at adding to your current application base.
Either way, dealing with persistence can be tricky.
Tenants must not see each other’s data, but be allowed to operate simultaneously.
Your application must also perform well while still being easy to maintain.
Rhuan Rocha has started a two part series on how to use JPA with Multitenancy over on the Red Hat Developer blog.
<a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/06/15/jakarta-ee-multitenancy-with-jpa-on-wildfly-part-1/">The first entry</a> details the problem and presents a possible solution using WildFly and EJBs.
Expect the next installment to look more at Hibernate and JPA solutions.</p>
<p>Effortlessly building a native application is of course, one of the amazing capabilities of Quarkus.
However, when it comes to debugging, a native Quarkus application makes debugging <strong>very</strong> difficult.
A large part of this is the optimizations that happen to create that quick, small, native binary.
This debugging complication hasn’t gone unnoticed.
Andrew Dinn has been working on this problem.
He contributed a solution where the debug information is embedded with in the native image and can be access with <code>gdb</code>.
If you’d like to learn more about the solution, <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/06/25/debugging-graalvm-native-images-using-gdb/">read Andrew’s blog entry</a>.</p>
<p>Continuing with the Quarkus theme, Durgesh Anaokar wrote about <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/06/19/develop-and-test-a-quarkus-client-on-red-hat-codeready-containers-with-red-hat-data-grid-8-0/">developing and testing a Quarkus Red Hat Data Grid client using Red Hat CodeReady Containers</a>.
Durgesh details installing CRC (Red Hat Code Ready Containers) and Data Grid on OpenShift 4 as well as running the client.
Naturally, his project code is hosted in GitHub, you’ll find that link in his blog entry.</p>
<p>Red Hat now has images, Universal Base Images to be exact, of OpenJDK (8 and 11) in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.2.
A Universal Base Image (UBI) is an OCI-compliant container base OS image with runtime and language support that can be used as the base for Docker images and Podman/Buildah images.
These will allow you to deploy and build supportable applications on Red Hat OpenShift and RHEL.
It also includes a number of additional user-space packages over a base UBI.
Read more about this <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/06/25/introducing-the-red-hat-build-of-the-openjdk-universal-base-images-now-in-red-hat-enterprise-linux-8-2/">over at Red Hat Developers</a>.</p>
<p>If you have been following, you’ll know the Infinispan team has been hard at work on Infinispan 11.
They are proud to announce that <a href="https://infinispan.org/blog/2020/06/15/infinispan-11/">Inifinspan 11.0.0. Final has been released</a>!
A number of improvements and features have been added to this release including clustering, CLI, Hot Rod Client improvements, non-blocking internals, and others.</p>
<p>Along with that new Infinispan release, you can now deploy a <a href="https://infinispan.org/blog/2020/06/16/native-server-announce/">natively compiled version of the Infinispan server</a>!
The memory footprint is only 286MB.
There are also native Quarkus extensions for your Quarkus based applications.</p>
<p>Not to be left out of the cloud native party, Apache Camel is <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/06/18/camel-k-1-0-the-serverless-integration-platform-goes-ga/">announcing the GA release of Apache Camel K 1.0</a>.
This release includes tooling, connectors, and integrations with Knative.
This is a great step forward for doing integrations with a small footprint.</p>
<p>Lastly, <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/06/17/red-hat-jboss-enterprise-application-platform-expansion-pack-1-0-released/">Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform Expansion Pack 1.0</a> was recently released.
This is a patch that adds MicroProfile capabilities to JBoss EAP.
There are some policy changes you will need to be aware of, but you find links to all of thosewithin the announcement.</p>
<p>Thanks again for being with us on another JBoss Editorial!</p>

<h2 id="_2020_04_30_the_virtual_red_hat_summit_week">[2020-04-30] - The Virtual Red Hat Summit week</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<p>I’m writing this as we wrap up another successful Red Hat Summit.
But this year, with a significant distinction: the event was 100%
virtual. Despite the involuntary move to virtual, there were many
benefits that came about from the change in format. The event was
completely free, and of course required no travel, allowing a much
broader and more diverse set of attendees to benefit from the
content and experience. It was also ran in three regions to
accommodate many more timezones.</p>
<p>Being Red Hat we were keen to experiment with the format and find
new ways to engage with the community. It was important for us to
carry over as much of the personality and intimacy of the physical
event as possible. So, this needed to be more than just a bunch of
streamed talks. The talks were pre-recorded which allowed the
presenter(s) to participate directly in the Q&amp;A in real-time
as the talk proceeded. There was also a variety of sessions that
went beyond the talk format. For examples see
<em>Ask the experts</em>, <em>Networking social hour</em>, and
the <em>Virtual Open Neighborhood</em> on the
<a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/summit/agenda/agenda-at-a-glance">agenda</a>.</p>
<p>If you weren’t able to attend, or want to catch some of the
talks you missed, you can <a href="https://onlinexperiences.com/Launch/QReg.htm?ShowUUID=4245E6E3-7D25-496D-9B08-4CBDC87CCE74">re-live the virtual event here</a>.</p>
